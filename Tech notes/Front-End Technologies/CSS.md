Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for specifying the presentation and styling of a document written in a markup language such as [[HTML]] or [[XML]] (including XML dialects such as [[SVG]], MathML or [[XHTML]]).
CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and [[JavaScript]].

CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and presentation, including layout, colors, and fonts.
This separation can improve:
- content accessibility, since the content can be written without concern for its presentation; 
- provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics; 
- enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate `.css` file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content; 
- and enable the `.css` file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.

## Frameworks

CSS frameworks are prepared libraries that are meant to allow for easier, more standards-compliant styling of web pages using the Cascading Style Sheets language. 
CSS frameworks include Blueprint, [[Bootstrap]], Foundation and Materialize.
