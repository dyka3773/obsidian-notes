A secure cookie can only be transmitted over an encrypted connection (i.e. [[HTTPS]]).
They cannot be transmitted over unencrypted connections (i.e. [[HTTP]]).
This makes the cookie less likely to be exposed to cookie theft via [[eavesdropping]].
A [[cookie]] is made secure by adding the `Secure` flag to the [[cookie]].
