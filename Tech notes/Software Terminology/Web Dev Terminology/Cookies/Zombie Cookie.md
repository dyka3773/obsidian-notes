A zombie cookie is data and code that has been placed by a web server on a visitor's computer or other device in a hidden location outside the visitor's web browser's dedicated [[cookie]] storage location, and that automatically recreates a [[Cookie|HTTP cookie]] as a regular [[cookie]] after the original [[cookie]] had been deleted.
The zombie cookie may be stored in multiple locations, such as [[HTML5 Web storage]], and other client-side and even server-side locations, and when absence is detected in one of the locations, the missing instance is recreated by the [[JavaScript]] code using the data stored in other locations.
