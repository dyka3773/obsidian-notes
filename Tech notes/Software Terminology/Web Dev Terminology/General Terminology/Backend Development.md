Backend development is one of the most central web development terms you will come across during any website development project.
It refers to the server-side coding and structuring that goes into developing and maintaining a website.
Developers will use programming languages, such as [[Java]] and SQL, to create the backend components, which can include [[databases]], [[web services]], [[API]]s and more.
