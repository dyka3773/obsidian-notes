The GET method requests that the target resource transfer a representation of its state.
GET requests should only retrieve data and should have no other effect.
For retrieving resources without making changes, GET is preferred over [[POST]], as they can be addressed through a URL.
This enables bookmarking and sharing and makes GET responses eligible for caching, which can save bandwidth.
