Selenium is an [[open source]] umbrella project for a range of tools and libraries aimed at supporting browser automation.
It provides a playback tool for authoring [[functional tests]] across most modern web browsers, without the need to learn a test scripting language.
It also provides a test domain-specific language to write tests in a number of popular programming languages, including [[JavaScript]] ([[Node.js]]), [[C#]], [[Groovy]], [[Java]], [[Perl]], [[PHP]], [[Python]], [[Ruby]] and [[Scala]].

Selenium is an open-source automation framework for web applications, enabling testers and developers to automate browser interactions and perform [[Black-box Testing|functional testing]]. 
With versatile tools like WebDriver, Selenium supports various programming languages and facilitates cross-browser testing, making it a go-to choice for efficient and [[Scalability|scalable]] web automation.
