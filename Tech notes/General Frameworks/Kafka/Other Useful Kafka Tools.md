> **Note:** The [[REST Proxy]], [[KSQLdb|KSQL]], [[Kafka Connect]] and [[Control Center]] are all part of the Confluent Platform. They are not part of the Apache [[Kafka]] project, but they are open-source and free to use. BUT since they are part of the Confluent Platform, some of them are not free for enterprise use (eg [[Control Center]]).
