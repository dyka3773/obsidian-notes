- `__enter__`: The enter method. It is called when the `with` statement is used on an object. (It is called before the `with` statement's code block is executed.)
- `__exit__`: The exit method. It is called when the `with` statement is used on an object. (It is called even if an [[Exceptions & Errors|exception]] is raised inside the `with` statement or when the `with` statement ends normally.)
- `__len__`: The length method. It is called when the `len()` function is called on an object.
- `__contains__`: The contains method. It is called when the `in` operator is used on an object.
- `__del__`: The destructor method. It is called when an object is about to be destroyed and it allows the class to perform any cleanup actions. (It is rarely used.)
