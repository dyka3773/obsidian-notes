There are 4 types of casing in [[Python]]:
- `snake_case` : All lowercase letters and words are separated by underscores. This is used for `variable` names, `function` names, `module` names, etc.
- `PascalCase` : All words are capitalized and there are no separators. This is used for `class` names.
- `camelCase` : All words are capitalized except the first one and there are no separators. This is also used for `class` names, but it is less common than `PascalCase`.
- `UPPER_CASE` : All letters are capitalized and words are separated by underscores. This is used for `constants`.
