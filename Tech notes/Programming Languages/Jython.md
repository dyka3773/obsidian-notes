Jython is an implementation of the [[Python]] programming language designed to run on the [[Java platform]]. 
It was known as JPython until 1999.

Jython programs can import and use any [[Java]] class. 
Except for some standard [[Packages & Modules|modules]], Jython programs use [[Java]] classes instead of [[Packages & Modules|Python modules]]. 
Jython includes almost all of the [[Packages & Modules|modules]] in the standard [[Python]] programming language distribution, lacking only some of the [[Packages & Modules|modules]] implemented originally in C. 
For example, a user interface in Jython could be written with Swing, AWT or SWT. 
Jython compiles [[Python]] source code to [[Java]] bytecode (an intermediate language) either on demand or statically.

## Popular tools that use it
- [[JBoss Application Server]] in its [[CLI]]
- [[Weblogic]]'s Scripting Tool
- [[Ghidra]] allows using either [[Java]] or Jython for its plugins
