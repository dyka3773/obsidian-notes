At work, in our [[Java]] projects we mostly use the [[Apache CXF]] framework for dealing with [[Web Services|WS]].
Through [[Apache CXF]] you can easily generate a WS-client (based on a [[WSDL]]), or create a [[Web Services|WS]] (most commonly starting from [[Java]] code, exposing specific methods as WS endpoint methods).

The main standards for building webservices using [[Java]] are:
- [[JAX-WS]] (old was JAX-RPC)
- [[JAX-RS]] ([[REST|RESTful]] services)
