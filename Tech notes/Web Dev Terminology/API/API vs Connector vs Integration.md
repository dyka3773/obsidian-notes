- [[API]]s (application programming interfaces) are widely used and instrumental in the digital world, their primary function in simplifying processes and speeding up the development of other systems and applications.
- Connectors are pre-built software packages which help to interact with external applications or data sources.
- Integration application is the process of enabling systems to communicate and interact with each other.

Integration applications use connectors to connect into systems via the APIs that those systems expose. Connectors make it easier for the creator of the integration application to work with those APIs since they donâ€™t have to program directly against those APIs. Overall, APIs make it easier to get data in and out of the systems as they are usually included within these systems.
