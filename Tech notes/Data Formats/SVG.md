Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) is an [[XML]]-based vector image format for defining two-dimensional graphics, having support for interactivity and animation.

SVG images are defined in a vector graphics format and stored in [[XML]] text files. 
SVG images can thus be scaled in size without loss of quality, and SVG files can be searched, indexed, scripted, and compressed. 
The [[XML]] text files can be created and edited with text editors or vector graphics editors, and are rendered by most web browsers. 
If used for images, SVG can host scripts or [[CSS]], potentially leading to [[cross-site scripting]] attacks or other security vulnerabilities.
