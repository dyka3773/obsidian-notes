**Search Engine Optimization (SEO)** is the practice of improving a website’s visibility in **search engine results pages** in order to increase **organic (non-paid) traffic**.
It involves both technical and content-related strategies aimed at ensuring a site is understandable and relevant to search engines like Google, Bing, and others.
# Types of SEO

- **Social signals**: Mentions and shares on social media (indirect impact).
- **Brand mentions**: Recognition across the web.
