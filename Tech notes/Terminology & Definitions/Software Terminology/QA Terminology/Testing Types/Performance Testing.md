Performance testing is generally executed to determine how a system or sub-system performs in terms of responsiveness and stability under a particular workload.
It can also serve to investigate, measure, validate or verify other quality attributes of the system, such as [[scalability]], reliability and resource usage.

- **Load testing** is primarily concerned with testing that the system can continue to operate under a specific load, whether that be large quantities of data or a large number of users.
> This is generally referred to as software [[Scalability]].
- The related load testing activity of when performed as a non-functional activity is often referred to as **endurance testing**.
- **Volume testing** is a way to test software functions even when certain components (for example a file or [[Databases|database]]) increase radically in size.
- **Stress testing** is a way to test reliability under unexpected or rare workloads.

There is little agreement on what the specific goals of performance testing are. 
The terms load testing, performance testing, [[scalability]] testing, and volume testing, are often used interchangeably.
