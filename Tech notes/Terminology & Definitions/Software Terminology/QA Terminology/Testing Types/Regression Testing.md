**Regression testing** is a type of software testing that focuses on **verifying that existing functionality still works as intended after code changes**.
These changes can include:
- Bug fixes
- New features
- Code refactoring
- Performance improvements
- Dependency updates
The goal is to **ensure that nothing that previously worked has been broken** as a result of modifications.
# Why Is It Important?
When you make a change to a software system, even a small one, it can have unintended side effects.
**Regression testing mitigates the risk** of such issues by retesting previously tested components.
# Key Characteristics
- **Broad scope**: Covers both affected and potentially unaffected areas.
- **Repetitive**: Often run repeatedly after each major change.
- **Automated**: Ideally part of the [[CI/CD]] pipeline for speed and consistency.
- **Risk-based**: High-risk or business-critical areas often get prioritized.
# Best Practices
- Automate frequently-run tests.
- Prioritize critical functionality and high-risk areas.
- Maintain a **clean, updated test suite**.
- Use **version control** to track test changes.
- Integrate with CI/CD pipelines.
- Monitor [[Code Coverage|test coverage]].
