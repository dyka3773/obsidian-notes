White-box testing (also known as clear box testing, glass box testing, transparent box testing, and structural testing) verifies the internal structures or workings of a program, as opposed to the functionality exposed to the end-user.
In white-box testing, an internal perspective of the system (the source code), as well as programming skills are used to design test cases.
The tester chooses inputs to exercise paths through the code and determines the appropriate outputs.

While white-box testing can be applied at the unit, integration, and system levels of the software testing process, it is usually done at the unit level.
It can test paths within a unit, paths between units during integration, and between subsystems during a system-level test.
Though this method of test design can uncover many errors or problems, it might not detect unimplemented parts of the specification or missing requirements.

Techniques used in white-box testing include:
- [[Code Coverage]]
- [[Fault Injection]]
- [[Static Testing]]
