**Open Source** refers to software whose **source code is publicly available**, allowing anyone to view, modify, and distribute it.
Open-source software (OSS) promotes **collaboration, transparency, and community-driven development**.
- **Key Idea:** Users can freely use, modify, and share the software.
- **Examples:** Linux, [[Git]], [[Python]], Apache, PostgreSQL.

# Popular Open Source Licenses
- **GNU General Public License (GPL)**: Requires derivative works to be open-source (copyleft).
- **MIT License**: Very permissive; allows modification and distribution without restrictions.
- **Apache License**: Similar to MIT but includes patent protections.
- **BSD License**: Permissive, with minimal restrictions.
- **Creative Commons (CC)**: Often used for non-software works.
> **GPL vs. MIT:** GPL ensures modifications remain open-source, while MIT allows proprietary modifications.
