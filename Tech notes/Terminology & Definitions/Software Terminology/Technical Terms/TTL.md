Time-To-Live (TTL) is a mechanism that limits the lifespan or validity of data in networks, [[caching]], and [[databases]]. 
It ensures that data is refreshed periodically and prevents outdated or unnecessary information from persisting indefinitely.

# TTL in Different Contexts
## 1. Networking (IP Packet TTL)
- **Purpose:** Prevents packets from circulating indefinitely in case of routing loops.
- **How It Works:**
    - Every IP packet has a **TTL field** (integer).
    - The value **decreases by 1** every time the packet passes through a router.
    - If TTL reaches **0**, the packet is discarded, and an ICMP "Time Exceeded" message is sent back.
- **Example:** A packet with an initial TTL of `64` can pass through at most 64 routers before being dropped.
## 2. Caching ([[CDN|CDNs]], Web, [[Databases]])
- **Purpose:** Defines how long a cached item remains valid before being evicted or refreshed.
- **How It Works:**
    - Used in **[[Redis]], Memcached, [[HTTP]] caching, and [[CDN|Content Delivery Networks]] ([[CDN]]s)**.
    - Helps reduce [[Databases|database]] load and improve response times.
- **Example:** A [[Redis]] key with TTL of `600` seconds (10 minutes) will be automatically removed after that time.
## 3. [[Message Queue|Messaging Queues]] ([[RabbitMQ]], [[Kafka]])
- **Purpose:** Determines how long messages remain in a queue before being deleted.
- **Example:** In [[RabbitMQ]], messages can have an expiration time (`x-message-ttl`) after which they are discarded.

# Why TTL Matters
- **Optimizes Performance** – Prevents unnecessary processing and network traffic.  
- **Manages Resource Expiry** – Automatically removes outdated or stale data.  
- **Enhances Security** – Prevents sensitive data from persisting longer than necessary.
