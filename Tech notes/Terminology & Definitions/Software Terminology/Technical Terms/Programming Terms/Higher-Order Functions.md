A **Higher-Order Function (HOF)** is a function that **either takes one or more functions as arguments or returns a function as a result**.

This concept is fundamental in **functional programming** and is commonly found in languages like **[[JavaScript]], [[Python]], [[Haskell]], and [[Lisp]]**.

- They also enable functional programming paradigms like [[map()|map]], [[filter()|filter]], and [[reduce()|reduce]].
- All higher-order functions rely on first-class functions, but not all first-class functions are higher-order functions.
