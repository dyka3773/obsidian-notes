**Software Architecture Pattern** refers to a reusable, proven solution to a recurring problem at the system level, addressing concerns related to the overall structure, component interactions, and quality attributes of the system.
Software architecture patterns operate at a higher level of abstraction than software [[design patterns]], solving broader system-level challenges.
While these patterns typically affect system-level concerns, the distinction between architectural patterns and architectural styles can sometimes be blurry.

**Software Architecture Style**Â refers to a high-level structural organization that defines the overall system organization, specifying how components are organized, how they interact, and the constraints on those interactions.
Architecture styles typically include a vocabulary of component and connector types, as well as semantic models for interpreting the system's properties.
These styles represent the most coarse-grained level of system organization.

# Examples of architecture styles
- [[Event-driven architecture]]
- [[Microservices]]
- [[Monolithic]]

# Examples of architecture patterns
- [[MVC]]
- [[publisher/subscriber pattern]]
