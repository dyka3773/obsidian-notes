In software engineering, a software design pattern or design pattern is a general, reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem in many contexts in software design.
A design pattern is not a rigid structure to be transplanted directly into source code.
Rather, it is a description or a template for solving a particular type of problem that can be deployed in many different situations.
Design patterns can be viewed as formalized best practices that the programmer may use to solve common problems when designing a software application or system.

[[Object-oriented]] design patterns typically show relationships and interactions between classes or objects, without specifying the final application classes or objects that are involved.

Design patterns may be viewed as a structured approach to computer programming intermediate between the levels of a programming paradigm and a concrete algorithm.

## Examples

- Creational Patterns
	- [[Builder]]
	- [[Dependency Injection]]
	- [[Factory method]]
	- Lazy Patterns:
		- [[Lazy Initialization]]
		- [[Lazy Evaluation]]
		- [[Lazy Loading]] and its implementations:
			- [[Lazy Initialization]] (yes, the same as above)
			- [[Virtual Proxy]]
			- [[Ghost]]
			- [[Value Holder]]
	- [[Singleton]]
- Structural
	- [[Decorator]]
	- [[Proxy]]
- Behavioral
	- [[Iterator]]
	- [[Observer]]
	- [[Strategy]]
- Concurrency

	- [[Scheduler]]
	- [[Thread Pool]]
- [[Architecture Design Patterns|Architecture Patterns]]
	- [[Databases|Database]]-related patterns
		- [[DAO]]
		- [[Repository]]
	- [[Frontend Development|Frontend]]-[[Backend Development|Backend]] integration patterns
		- [[MVC]]
