In computer science, ACID ([[Atomicity]], [[Consistency]], [[Isolation]], [[Durability]]) is a set of properties of [[database transactions]] intended to guarantee data validity despite errors, power failures, and other mishaps.
In the context of [[databases]], a sequence of [[Databases|database]] operations that satisfies the ACID properties (which can be perceived as a single logical operation on the data) is called a [[Database Transactions|transaction]].
For example, a transfer of funds from one bank account to another, even involving multiple changes such as debiting one account and crediting another, is a single [[Transactions|transaction]].
