A **Command-Line Interface (CLI)** is a text-based interface used to interact with a computer or software by typing commands into a terminal or console.
Unlike **Graphical User Interfaces (GUI)**, which rely on visual elements like buttons and icons, CLI provides **direct access** to system functionalities through command execution.

**Examples of CLI Applications:**
- **Operating System Shells**: [[Bash]] (Linux), [[PowerShell]] (Windows), Zsh, Command Prompt
- **Programming Language [[REPL]]s**: [[Python]] (`python`), [[Node.js]] (`node`), Ruby (`irb`)
- **[[Databases|Database]] Clients**: MySQL CLI, PostgreSQL CLI
- **Version Control**: [[Git]] (`git commit -m "message"`)
