LIFO (Last-In, First-Out) and FIFO (First-In, First-Out) are fundamental concepts in data structures and inventory management.
They define the order in which items are processed or removed from a collection.
Understanding these principles is crucial for efficient data handling and resource management.

# FIFO
- FIFO dictates that the first item added to a collection is the first item to be removed.
- This method simulates a real-world queue, where items are processed in the order they arrive.
## Applications
- Queues (Data Structures):
	- FIFO is the core principle behind queue data structures.
	- Used for scheduling tasks, handling requests, and managing data streams.
- Networking:
	- Packet transmission often follows FIFO to maintain the order of data packets.

# LIFO
- LIFO dictates that the last item added to a collection is the first item to be removed.
- This method simulates a stack, where the most recent items are accessed first.
## Applications
- **Stacks (Data Structures):**
	- LIFO is the core principle behind stack data structures.
	- Used in function call stacks and expression evaluation.
- **Undo/Redo Operations:**
	- Applications use LIFO to reverse actions in the order they were performed.
