Text-to-SQL is a **natural language processing (NLP) technique** that enables users to query [[relational databases]] using **plain English** (or any human language) instead of writing [[SQL]] queries.
This allows non-technical users to interact with [[databases]] **without knowing [[SQL]] syntax**.
#### **Example:**
**User Input (Natural Language Query):**  
_"Show me all employees who joined after 2020 and work in the IT department."_
**Generated [[SQL]] Query:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM employees 
WHERE join_date > '2020-01-01' 
AND department = 'IT';
```

# Why is Text-to-SQL Important?
- Bridges the gap between non-technical users and [[databases]].
- Speeds up data retrieval for business analysts, managers, and researchers.
- Reduces errors in manual query writing.
- Improves accessibility of data-driven decision-making.

# How Text-to-SQL Works
## Key Components
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Understands and processes user input.
- **Semantic Parsing:** Converts text into a structured format.
- **[[SQL]] Generation:** Translates structured format into [[SQL]] queries.
- **[[Databases|Database]] Execution:** Runs the query and retrieves results..
## Processing Pipeline
1. **Text Preprocessing:** Tokenization, stopword removal, stemming.
2. **Entity Recognition:** Identifies [[Databases|database]] table and column names.
3. **Query Construction:** Maps user intent to [[SQL]] syntax.
4. **Execution & Response:** Runs [[SQL]] and returns results.

# Approaches to Text-to-SQL
## 1. Rule-Based Approach
- Uses **predefined templates and pattern matching**.
- Works well for structured, **domain-specific applications**.
- **Limitations:** Cannot handle complex queries or ambiguous user input.
## 2. Machine Learning-Based Approach
- Uses **supervised learning on large datasets** (e.g., Spider, WikiSQL).
- Models like **Transformers, Seq2Seq, BERT, T5, and GPT** generate [[SQL]] queries.
- **More flexible** but requires **large datasets** and **training**.
## 3. Hybrid Approach
- Combines **rule-based methods** with **ML/NLP models**.
- **Best of both worlds** â€“ good accuracy and flexibility.
