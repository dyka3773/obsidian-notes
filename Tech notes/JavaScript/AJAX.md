**Ajax** (also **AJAX**; short for "asynchronous [[JavaScript]] and [[XML]]") is a set of web development techniques that uses various web technologies on the client-side to create asynchronous web applications.
With Ajax, web applications can send and retrieve data from a server asynchronously (in the background) without interfering with the display and behaviour of the existing page.
By decoupling the data interchange layer from the presentation layer, Ajax allows web pages and, by extension, web applications, to change content dynamically without the need to reload the entire page.
In practice, modern implementations commonly utilize [[JSON]] instead of [[XML]].

Ajax is not a technology, but rather a programming pattern.
Ajax is not a new technology, nor is it a new language. 
Instead, it is existing technologies used in a new way.
