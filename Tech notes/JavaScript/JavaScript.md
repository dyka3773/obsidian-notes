**JavaScript** often abbreviated as **JS**, is a programming language and core technology of the Web, alongside [[HTML]] and [[CSS]]. 
99% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for webpage behavior.

Web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine that executes the client code.
These engines are also utilized in some servers and a variety of apps.
The most popular runtime system for non-browser usage is [[Node.js]].

JavaScript is a high-level, often [[just-in-time compiled]] language that conforms to the [[ECMAScript]] standard.
It has [[dynamic typing]], [[prototype-based]] [[object-orientation]], and [[first-class functions]].
It is [[multi-paradigm]], supporting [[event-driven]], [[functional]], and [[imperative programming]] styles.
It has application programming interfaces ([[API]]s) for working with text, dates, [[regular expressions]], standard data structures, and the [[Document Object Model]] (DOM).

Although [[Java]] and JavaScript are similar in name and syntax, the two languages are distinct and differ greatly in design.

## Related Technologies
### Java
A common misconception is that JavaScript is directly related to [[Java]].
Both indeed have a [[C]]-like syntax (the [[C]] language being their most immediate common ancestor language).
In particular, all [[Java]] keywords were reserved in original JavaScript, JavaScript's standard library follows Java's naming conventions, and JavaScript's `Math` and `Date` objects are based on classes from Java 1.0.

The differences between the two languages are more prominent than their similarities.
- [[Java]] has [[static typing]], while JavaScript's typing is dynamic.
- [[Java]] is loaded from compiled bytecode, while JavaScript is loaded as human-readable source code.
- [[Java]]'s objects are [[class-based]], while JavaScript's are [[prototype-based]]
- [[Java]] did not support functional programming until Java 8, while JavaScript has done so from the beginning.

### JSON
[[JSON]] is a data format derived from JavaScript; hence the name JavaScript Object Notation. 
It is a widely used format supported by many other programming languages.

### Transpilers
Many websites are JavaScript-heavy, so [[transpilers]] have been created to convert code written in other languages, which can aid the development process.

[[TypeScript]] and CoffeeScript are two notable languages that transpile to JavaScript.

### WebAssembly
[[WebAssembly]] is a newer language with a bytecode format designed to complement JavaScript, especially the performance-critical portions of web page scripts.
