jQuery is a [[JavaScript]] library designed to simplify [[HTML]] [[DOM]] tree traversal and manipulation, as well as event handling, [[CSS]] animations, and [[AJAX]].
jQuery also provides capabilities for developers to create plug-ins on top of the [[JavaScript]] library. 
This enables developers to create abstractions for low-level interaction and animation, advanced effects and high-level, theme-able widgets. 
The modular approach to the jQuery library allows the creation of powerful dynamic web pages and Web applications.

jQuery, at its core, is a [[Document Object Model]] (DOM) manipulation library.
The DOM is a tree-structure representation of all the elements of a Web page. 
jQuery simplifies the syntax for finding, selecting, and manipulating these DOM elements. 
For example, jQuery can be used for finding an element in the document with a certain property (e.g. all elements with the `h1` tag), changing one or more of its attributes (e.g. `color`, `visibility`), or making it respond to an event (e.g. a mouse click).

The principles of developing with jQuery are:
- **Separation of JavaScript and HTML**: The jQuery library provides simple syntax for adding [[event handlers]] to the [[DOM]] using [[JavaScript]], rather than adding [[HTML]] event attributes to call [[JavaScript]] functions. Thus, it encourages developers to completely separate [[JavaScript]] code from [[HTML]] markup.
- **Brevity and clarity**: jQuery promotes brevity and clarity with features like "[[jQuery Method Chaining|chainable]]" functions and shorthand function names.
- **Elimination of cross-browser incompatibilities**: The JavaScript engines of different browsers differ slightly so JavaScript code that works for one browser may not work for another. Like other JavaScript toolkits, jQuery handles all these cross-browser inconsistencies and provides a consistent interface that works across different browsers.
- **Extensibility**: New events, elements, and methods can be easily added and then reused as a plugin.
