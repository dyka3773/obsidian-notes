The Java platform is a suite of programs that facilitate developing and running programs written in the [[Java]] programming language.
A Java platform includes an execution engine (called a [[JVM|virtual machine]]), a compiler and a set of libraries.
There may also be additional servers and alternative libraries that depend on the requirements.
Java platforms have been implemented for a wide variety of hardware and operating systems with a view to enable [[Java]] programs to run identically on all of them.

It consists of several programs, each of which provides a portion of its overall capabilities.
