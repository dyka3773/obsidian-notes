Spring Boot makes it easy to create stand-alone, production-grade [[Spring]] based Applications that you can "just run".
It takes an opinionated view of the [[Spring]] platform and third-party libraries so you can get started with minimum fuss. 
Most Spring Boot applications need minimal [[Spring]] configuration.
