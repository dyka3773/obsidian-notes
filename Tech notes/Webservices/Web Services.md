A service offered by an electronic device to another electronic device, communicating with each other via the Internet.
In a web service, a web technology such as [[HTTP]] is used for transferring machine-readable file formats such as [[XML]] and [[JSON]].

In practice, a web service commonly provides an [[object-oriented]] web-based interface to a database server, utilized for example by another web server, or by a mobile app, that provides a user interface to the end-user. 
Many organizations that provide data in formatted [[HTML]] pages will also provide that data on their server as [[XML]] or [[JSON]], often through a Web service to allow [syndication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_syndication "Web syndication"). 

## Technologies and protocols related to web services

## W3C definition

Software system designed to support interoperable **machine-to-machine interaction over a network**. It has an interface described in a machine-processable format (specifically **[[WSDL]]**). Systems **interact** with the web service in a **manner prescribed by its description ([[WSDL]]) using [[SOAP]]-messages**, typically conveyed using [[HTTP]] with an [[XML]] serialization in conjunction with other web-related standards.

Webservices is [[xml]]-based language-independent communication protocol which supports:
- Remotely executing methods
- handling errors
- authentication/authorization
