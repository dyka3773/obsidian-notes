Web Services Security (WS-Security, WSS) is an extension to [[SOAP]] to apply security to [[Web services]]. 
The protocol specifies how integrity and confidentiality can be enforced on messages and allows the communication of various security token formats, such as Security Assertion Markup Language ([[SAML]]),  [Kerberos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerberos_(protocol) "Kerberos (protocol)"), and [X.509](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.509 "X.509"). 
Its main focus is the use of [[XML Signature]] and [[XML Encryption]] to provide end-to-end security.
