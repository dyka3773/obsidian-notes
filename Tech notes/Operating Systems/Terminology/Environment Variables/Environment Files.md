Many frameworks and tools support `.env` files that store [[environment variables]] in a [[Key-Value Pairs|key-value]] format.
These are commonly used in web apps.
They are loaded into the app using tools like `dotenv` ([[Node.js]]) or `python-dotenv`([[Python]]).
### Example file
```dotenv
DEBUG=true
PORT=8000
SECRET_KEY=s3cr3t
```
