## Introduction

In [[Python]], there are a lot of methods and attributes that start and end with double underscores. 
These are called dunder methods and dunder attributes.
(They are also called magic methods and magic attributes)

Most of them have derived from the early prototypes of [[Python]], and they are used to implement a lot of the language's features.
This means that some of them should not be used directly or overridden, unless you know what you are doing. Plus, some of them are rarely used.

Let's take a look at some of them.
There are:
- [[General purpose dunder methods]]
- [[Dunder methods for representing objects]]
- [[Dunder methods for math operations]]
- [[Dunder methods for comparison or bitwise operations]]
- [[Dunder methods that are usually used inside statements]]
- [[Dunder attributes]]
- [[__init__.py]]
