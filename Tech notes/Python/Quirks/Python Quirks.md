As in every language, there are many features that are idiomatic to [[Python]]. 
My suggestion is to explore them as you go along.

I have also appended my notes on some these features in case they might be of help.

Here are some of these features:
- [[List Comprehension]]
- [[Lambda Functions]]
- [[Function Attributes]]
- [[Decorators]]
- [[Generators]] vs [[Iterables]] vs [[Iterators]] (see comparison in [[Iterators vs Iterables vs Generators example]])
- [f-strings and their shorthand](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#f-strings)
- [[args and kwargs]]
- [`__slots__`](https://stackoverflow.com/a/28059785/15552149)
- [[Global Interpreter Lock (GIL)]]
- [[Context Managers]]
- [[__call__]]
- [[Generics]] in [[Type hinting]]
- [[Double Underscore Methods and Attributes in Python|dunder]] Methods and Attributes
