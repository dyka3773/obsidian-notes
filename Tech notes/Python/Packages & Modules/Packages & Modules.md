## Introduction

Every [[Python]] file is a module, and every folder containing [[Python]] files is a package.

Packages can contain other packages and modules.
This allows you to organize your code into logical groups.

## Packages

Packages can be of 2 types:
- [[Regular Packages]]
- [[Namespace Packages]]

## Importing packages

See [[Imports]] and [[Relative Imports]].
