JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is an open standard file format and data interchange format that uses human-readable text to store and transmit data objects consisting of nameâ€“value pairs and arrays (or other serializable values).
JSON is a language-independent data format.
It was derived from [[JavaScript]], but many modern programming languages include code to generate and parse JSON-format data. 
JSON filenames use the extension `.json`.
