The Java platform is a suite of programs that facilitate developing and running programs written in the [[Java]] programming language.
A Java platform includes an execution engine (called a [[JVM|virtual machine]]), a compiler and a set of libraries.
There may also be additional servers and alternative libraries that depend on the requirements.
Java platforms have been implemented for a wide variety of hardware and operating systems with a view to enable [[Java]] programs to run identically on all of them.

It consists of several programs, each of which provides a portion of its overall capabilities.
Namely:
- Editions:
	- Java ME (Micro Edition): Specifies several different sets of libraries (known as profiles) for devices with limited storage, display, and power capacities.
	- [[Java SE]]
	- [[JavaEE|Jakarta EE]]
- [[JVM]]
- [[JDK]]
- [[Java Runtime Environment|JRE]]
- [[Java Class Library]]
### Languages
The [[Java]] language and the [[JVM|Java Virtual Machine]] should be treated as separate entities and so third parties have produced many compilers or interpreters that target the [[JVM]]. 
Some of these are for existing languages, while others are for extensions to the [[Java]] language. 
See also [[List of JVM languages]].

### Similar Platforms
The success of [[Java]] and its write once, run anywhere concept has led to other similar efforts, notably the [[.NET|.NET Framework]], appearing since 2002, which incorporates many of the successful aspects of [[Java]].
[[.NET]] was built from the ground-up to support multiple programming languages, while the Java platform was initially built to support only the [[Java]] language, although many other languages have been made for [[JVM]] since.
Like [[Java]], [[.NET]] languages compile to byte code and are executed by the Common Language Runtime (CLR), which is similar in purpose to the [[JVM]].
Like the [[JVM]], the CLR provides memory management through automatic garbage collection, and allows [[.NET]] byte code to run on multiple operating systems.
