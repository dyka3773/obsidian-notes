| **Feature**                 | **[[Java Runtime Environment\|JRE]]** | **[[JVM]]**         | **[[JDK]]**                         |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Purpose                     | Runs [[Java]] applications            | Executes bytecode   | Develops [[Java]] applications      |
| Includes [[JVM]]?           | Yes                                   | -                   | Yes                                 |
| Includes Development Tools? | No                                    | No                  | Yes (Compiler, Debugger, etc.)      |
| Use Case                    | Running [[Java]] programs             | Low-level execution | Writing and compiling [[Java]] code |

### **Conclusion:**
- **[[Java Runtime Environment|JRE]]** is required for **end users** who only want to run [[Java]] applications.
- **[[JDK]]** is required for **developers** to build and compile [[Java]] programs.
- **[[JVM]]** is a **part of both [[Java Runtime Environment|JRE]] and [[JDK]]**, responsible for executing [[Java]] bytecode.
