Jakarta Faces (JSF; formerly Jakarta Server Faces, before that JavaServer Faces) is a framework standard for developing graphical user interfaces for web applications.
Based on [[Servlet|servlets]] and [[JSP]] technology, JSF is one of the web technologies of [[JavaEE|Jakarta EE]].
With the help of JSF, the developer can easily integrate components for user interfaces into web pages and define the navigation. 
The prerequisites for developing JSF content are the [[JDK]], a [[Servlet]] container (e.g. [[Apache Tomcat]]) and a basic understanding of [[HTTP]] and [[Java]]. 
An [[IDEs and Editors|integrated development environment]] can be used to simplify development.
