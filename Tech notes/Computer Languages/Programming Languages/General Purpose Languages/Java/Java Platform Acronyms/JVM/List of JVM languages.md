This list of [[JVM]] Languages comprises notable computer programming languages that are used to produce computer software that runs on the [[JVM|Java virtual machine]] ([[JVM]]).
Some of these languages are interpreted by a [[Java]] program, and some are compiled to [[Java]] bytecode and [[JIT|just-in-time]] ([[JIT]]) compiled during execution as regular [[Java]] programs to improve performance.

The [[JVM]] was initially designed to support only the language [[Java]]. However, over time, ever more languages were adapted or designed to run on the [[Java Platform]].
