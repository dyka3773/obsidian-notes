Node.js is a cross-platform, open-source [[JavaScript]] runtime environment that can run on Windows, Linux, Unix, macOS, and more. 
Node.js runs on the V8 JavaScript engine, and executes [[JavaScript]] code outside a web browser.

Node.js lets developers use [[JavaScript]] to write command line tools and for server-side scripting.

Node.js has an [[Event-driven architecture]] capable of [[asynchronous I/O]]. 
These design choices aim to optimize throughput and [[scalability]] in web applications with many input/output operations, as well as for real-time Web applications (e.g., real-time communication programs and browser games).

[[JavaScript]] is the only language that Node.js supports natively, but many compile-to-JS languages are available.
As a result, Node.js applications can be written in CoffeeScript, [[Dart]], [[TypeScript]], ClojureScript and others.

Node.js is primarily used to build network programs such as web servers.
The most significant difference between Node.js and [[PHP]] is that most functions in [[PHP]] block until completion (commands execute only after previous commands finish), while Node.js functions are non-blocking (commands execute concurrently and use callbacks to signal completion or failure), thus opening up new attack surfaces that are inherently absent in most web server applications.
