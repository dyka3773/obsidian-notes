Comments are used to explain certain lines of code in plain English. They are not executed when the code is run.

```python
# This is a single-line comment

"""
This is a multi-line comment
"""
```

> **Note 1**: Triple quotes are used to span the comment across multiple lines, to create multi-line [[Strings]] and to create docstrings.

> Note 2: I think that depending on how you can compile your code, your comments can be omitted from the produced bytecode to make it more lightweight and fast.
