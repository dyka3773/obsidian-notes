XSLT (Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformations) is a language used to transform [[XML]] documents into other formats like [[HTML]], [[XML]], [[JSON]], or plain text.
It is part of the XSL (Extensible Stylesheet Language) family, designed for formatting and converting [[XML]] data.

**Key Characteristics:**
- **Transforms [[XML]] data** into a desired format.
- **Uses [[XPath]]** to navigate and select [[XML]] elements.
- **Applies templates** to process specific elements.
- **Works declaratively**: transformation rules are defined instead of imperatively coded.
