**Markdown** is a lightweight, easy-to-read, and easy-to-write **markup language** designed for formatting plain text. 
It is widely used in documentation, blogging, and content management systems due to its simplicity and compatibility with [[HTML]].

Created by John Gruber in 2004, Markdown allows users to write formatted documents without needing complex syntax like [[HTML]]. It is commonly used in README files, [[Static Site Generator]]s, and even messaging applications like Slack and Discord.

# Key Features of Markdown
- **Human-Readable** - The syntax is simple and easy to understand, even without rendering.
- **Portable** - Markdown files (`.md`) are plain text and can be opened on any device.
- **Extensible** - Supports **custom extensions** for additional features (tables, math formulas, task lists).
- **Compatible with [[HTML]]** - Markdown can be easily converted to **[[HTML]]** for web display.
- **Popular for Documentation** - Used in **GitHub README**, **Wiki pages**, and [[API]] documentation (e.g., [[OpenAPI]], [[Jupyter Notebooks]]).
