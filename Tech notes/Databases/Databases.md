Databases are a collection of data that is stored in a computer system.
They are used to store, retrieve, and manage data. 
Databases are used in many different applications, such as websites, mobile apps, and desktop applications. 
There are many different types of databases, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. 
Some of the most common types of databases include [[relational databases]], [[NoSQL databases]], and [[object-oriented databases]].

## [[Relational Databases]]

[[Relational databases]] are the most common type of database.
They store data in tables, which are made up of rows and columns.
Each row in a table represents a single record, and each column represents a single field.
[[Relational databases]] use a structured query language ([[SQL]]) to interact with the data.

Some popular [[relational databases]] include:
- [[MySQL]]
- [[PostgreSQL]]
- [[Oracle DBMS|Oracle]]
- [[SQL Server]]
- [[SQLite]]
- [[MariaDB]]
- [[IBM Db2]]
- [[Microsoft Access]]
- [[Databricks]]

## [[NoSQL Databases]]

[[NoSQL databases]] are a newer type of database that are designed to handle large amounts of [[unstructured data]].
They are often used in [[big data]] applications, where traditional [[relational databases]] would be too slow or too expensive.
[[NoSQL databases]] are more flexible than[[ relational databases]], and can store data in a variety of formats, such as [[key-value pairs]], documents, or graphs.

Some popular NoSQL databases include:
- [[MongoDB]]
- [[Cassandra]]
- [[Redis]]
- [[Couchbase]]
- [[Amazon DynamoDB]]
- [[Apache HBase]]
- [[Neo4j]]
- [[CouchDB]]

## [[Object-Oriented Databases]]

[[Object-oriented databases]] are a type of database that is designed to work with [[object-oriented]] programming languages.
They store data in objects, which are similar to the objects used in [[object-oriented]] programming.
[[Object-oriented databases]] are often used in applications that require complex [[data structures]], such as CAD/CAM systems, multimedia applications, and engineering applications.

Some popular object-oriented databases include:
- [[ObjectDB]]
- [[db4o]]
- [[ObjectStore]]
- [[Objectivity/DB]]
- [[Zope Object Database]]
- [[GemStone/S]]

## Conclusion

Databases are an essential part of modern computing.
They are used to store, retrieve, and manage data in a variety of applications.
There are many different types of databases, each with its own strengths and weaknesses.
[[Relational databases]] are the most common type of database, but [[NoSQL databases|NoSQL]] and [[object-oriented databases]] are becoming increasingly popular.
Each type of database has its own use cases, and the choice of database will depend on the specific requirements of the application.
