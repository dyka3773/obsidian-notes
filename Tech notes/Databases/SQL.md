Structured Query Language (SQL) is a domain-specific language used to manage data, especially in a relational database management system ([[Relational Databases|RDBMS]]).
It is particularly useful in handling structured data, i.e., data incorporating relations among entities and variables.

Originally based upon relational algebra and tuple relational calculus, SQL consists of many types of statements, which may be informally classed as sublanguages, commonly:
- Data query Language (DQL),
- Data Definition Language (DDL),
- Data Control Language (DCL),
- Data Manipulation Language (DML)

The scope of SQL includes data query, data manipulation (insert, update, and delete), data definition (schema creation and modification), and data access control.
Although SQL is essentially a declarative language, it also includes procedural elements.
