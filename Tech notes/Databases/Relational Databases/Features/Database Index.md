A database index is a data structure that improves the speed of data retrieval operations on a [[Databases|database]] table at the cost of additional writes and storage space to maintain the index data structure.
Indexes are used to quickly locate data without having to search every row in a [[Databases|database]] table every time said table is accessed.
Indexes can be created using one or more columns of a [[Databases|database]] table, providing the basis for both rapid random lookups and efficient access of ordered records.

An index is a copy of selected columns of data, from a table, that is designed to enable very efficient search.
