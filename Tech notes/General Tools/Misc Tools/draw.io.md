- A free online diagram software for making flowcharts, process diagrams, org charts, UML, ER and network diagrams.
- It can store images as [[XML]] files or [[SVG]] which is very useful when it comes to version control.
- It can also be used offline as a desktop application.
- It has a [VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=hediet.vscode-drawio) which allows you to edit draw.io files directly in [[Visual Studio Code]].
Â  > **Note:** I've found the [[Visual Studio Code]] extension to be a bit buggy, so I recommend using the online or desktop version instead.

Personally I've used it to make block diagrams that describe the business logic of a system, and it was very helpful and easy to use.
