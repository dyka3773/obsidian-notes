Jenkins is an open source automation server.
It helps automate the parts of software development related to building, testing, and deploying, facilitating CI/CD.
It is a server-based system that runs in servlet containers such as [[Apache Tomcat]], or by default as a stand-alone web-application in co-bundled [[Eclipse Jetty]].
It supports version control tools, including [[Git]] and can execute [[Apache Ant]], [[Apache Maven]], and [[sbt]] based projects as well as arbitrary shell scripts and Windows [[Batch]] commands.
