- A [[Java]] integrated development environment (IDE) for developing computer software.
- It is configurable and extensible through the use of plugins and has a built-in debugging support, embedded Git control, syntax highlighting, intelligent code completion, snippets, and code refactoring.
- It also supports many other languages such as Kotlin, Groovy, Scala, JavaScript, TypeScript, SQL, HTML, CSS, and more.
- It comes in an ecosystem of IDEs for other languages such as [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) for [[Python]], [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) for JavaScript, [PhpStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/) for [[PHP]], [RubyMine](https://www.jetbrains.com/ruby/) for Ruby, [Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/) for .NET, [GoLand](https://www.jetbrains.com/go/) for Go, and [CLion](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/) for C/C++. But the community edition of IntelliJ IDEA supports all of these languages.

I also intend to create [[A List of Useful Intellij Extensions]].
