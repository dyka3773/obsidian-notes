## GitLens *(ID: eamodio.gitlens)*

- This extension provides a variety of useful features for working with Git.
- I mostly use it to view the Git history of a file and to view the Git blame of a file.

## Git Graph *(ID: mhutchie.git-graph)*

- This is a lightweight extension that provides a visual representation of the Git history of a repository.
