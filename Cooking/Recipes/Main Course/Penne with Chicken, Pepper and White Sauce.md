# Ingredients
For 2-3 portions
- [ ] 1.5-2 portions of [[Pasta]] (preferably Penne)
- [ ] 1/2 cup of diced Red Peppers
- [ ] 1/2 cup of diced Green Peppers
- [ ] 1 diced Chicken breast
- [ ] 50-80ml of Milk
- [ ] 1 tbsp of Flour (optional)
- [ ] 2-3 tbsp of chopped Chives
- [ ] 2-3 tbsp of chopped Scallions
- [ ] Salt & Pepper
- [ ] 1 tsp Mustard powder
- [ ] 1 tbsp of Butter
- [ ] 1-2 tbsp of grated Parmigiano Reggiano or Grana Padano

# Directions
1. Season the chicken with the mustard, salt and pepper
2. Throw it in a hot oiled saucepan on medium-high heat
3. Cook until the pieces do not stick with each other (but still have a lot of leftover juices)
4. Throw in the peppers. chives and scallions and put the lid on the saucepan to let them soften up
5. By the time they are somewhat cooked, mix in the milk and butter, and lower the heat to medium-low to let it reduce itself
6. (Optional Step) In case you're in a hurry, feel free to add that tablespoon of flour, after the milk has started simmering, to emulsify the sauce faster.
7. When ready pour over your pasta portion, or feel free to mix the pasta in the sauce to suck up some of its juices.

# Other Notes
- In the optimal scenario, Step 5 should be performed in a time where the chicken hasn't formed a crust but has had some [[Maillard reaction]] and the vegetables are not completely cooked, since they will boil inside the sauce
