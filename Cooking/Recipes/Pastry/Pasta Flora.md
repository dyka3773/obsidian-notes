# Ingredients
For a circular tray of 23cms
- [ ] 250g of Flour
- [ ] 125g of Cold Butter
- [ ] 60g of Sugar
- [ ] 1 tsp of Salt
- [ ] 1 capsule of Vanillin
- [ ] 0.5 lemon's scrapes
- [ ] 1 Large (65-70g) Egg
- [ ] 1 Large (65-70g) Egg's Yolk
- [ ] Butter for the tray
- [ ] 500g of Jam (preferably Apricot, and preferably having a jelly consistency, not too runny)

# Directions
## For the Dough
1. Mix the Flour, Sugar and Salt using a mixer
2. Add the cold Butter cut in small pieces, starting and stopping the mixer keeping the dough as cold as possible and trying to achieve a wet sand texture
3. In a separate bowl, beat the eggs, the lemon scrapings and the vanillin
4. Add the mix in the mixer
5. When they merge, stop the mixer
6. Using your hands press the dough into a brick shape
7. Wrap it quickly with plastic wrap and put it in the fridge for 30 mins to get cold and stiffen up.
8. Heat up the oven to 170 C (190 C if no air option)
## For the Setup & Baking
1. Get the dough out of the fridge
2. Keep a 1/4 of the dough for garnish
3. Put the dough between 2 baking sheets and using a rolling pin roll out a thin sheet (~0.5cm)
4. Place the dough on the buttered baking tray, making sure the sides of the tray are also covered
5. Empty your jam mix over the dough
6. Use the leftover dough to make small laces of dough and tie them over the jam, making sure the laces are never submerged in the jam
7. Bake in the oven for 25 mins, in the second to top shelf, until the dough has become cookie-like
8. When done, let it rest and cool down so that the jam is less runny
