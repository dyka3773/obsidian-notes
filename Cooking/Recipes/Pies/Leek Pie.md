- [ ] 6 Leeks
- [ ] 3 Eggs
- [ ] 1.5tbsp Dill
- [ ] 2 cloves of Garlic

- [ ] 1tbsp of Butter
- [ ] 60g Feta per tray (Optional)

# Directions
1. Cut the leek in 1.5-2cm wide rolls
2. Boil it for 3 mins
3. Add all the greens (including the boiled leek) into a pan on low heat and caramelize them until they turn into a mush
4. Add the butter and give it a mix
5. Take all the ingredients out of the heat and let them cool off
6. While waiting them to cool off, cut the dough in 6-7 pieces for each tray you're using
7. Roll each piece very thin (~2mm) to the width and length of the tray you're using making sure there are 2-3cm of dough surplus outside of the tray
8. Pour olive oil below each sheet of [[Phyllo Dough|phyllo]] you're using
9. After laying about 3 sheets, go back to the filling
10. We will be breaking the eggs now in it, and mixing it up, but take care of the temperature cuz we don't want the eggs to cook. If more time is needed for it to cool down, just take a break :')
11. If you want to add Feta and Parm to the mixture, do it before putting in the eggs so that it cools the mix
12. Mix the filling well
13. Pour half of it in the tray over the sheets of dough
14. Repeat steps 7-8 until half of the initial dough is used up
15. Roll all of the excess dough around the tray tying it up to the edge of the pie
16. Cut the pie in pieces 
17. Put it in a preheated oven at ~180C for about 60-80 mins
