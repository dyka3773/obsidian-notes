# Aegean Piracy Overview

Pirates, privateers, and naval power in the Aegean Sea.

---
## Overview

**Core Concept**: The Aegean Sea is **pirate-infested** but not lawless. There are independent raiders *and* an organized alliance (like the Brethren Court from Pirates of the Caribbean).

**Why Pirates Matter to the Campaign**:
- Relics are transported by sea → Pirates intercept them
- [[Maritime City-State]] hires pirates as privateers
- Party might need to negotiate, fight, or join them
- Naval adventures add variety to the campaign

---
## The Two Types of Pirates

### 1. Independent Pirates (Chaotic)

**Who They Are**:
- Small crews (10-30 people per ship)
- Opportunistic raiders
- No allegiance to any faction or alliance
- Motivated by: Survival, greed, or revenge

**What They Do**:
- Raid merchant ships
- Smuggle goods between city-states
- Occasionally work as mercenaries (if the pay is good)

**Threat Level**: Low-Medium (dangerous to lone travelers, but not organized)

**Examples**:
- A desperate captain trying to feed their crew
- A former naval officer turned outlaw
- Refugees-turned-raiders (driven to piracy by poverty)

**Campaign Use**:
- Minor encounters (party fights them off or negotiates)
- Potential allies if the party offers better payment than victims would
- Source of rumors (pirates hear everything)

---
### 2. The Pirate Alliance (Organized)

**Name**: *The Aegean Compact* (or use a different name if you prefer)

**Inspired By**: Brethren Court (Pirates of the Caribbean)

**Who They Are**:
- A coalition of the most powerful pirate captains
- Each captain controls a fleet (3-10 ships)
- Loosely organized (they meet, vote, make decisions. But enforce them selectively)

**Structure**:
- **The Pirate Lords** (5-7 captains with seats at the table)
- **The Code** (rules pirates agree to follow --> more guidelines than laws)
- **Safe Havens** (islands where the Alliance guarantees safety)

**What They Do**:
- Control key trade routes
- Protect their members from navies
- Negotiate with city-states (sometimes as privateers, sometimes as threats)
- Hunt down pirates who break the Code

**Threat Level**: High (a unified pirate armada is a naval superpower)

**Campaign Use**:
- The party can join the Alliance (become pirates!)
- Negotiate with Pirate Lords (for ships, information, or passage)
- Fight the Alliance (if they're aligned with [[Maritime City-State]])

## The Aegean Compact (Pirate Alliance)

### The Pirate Lords (Major NPCs)

#### 1. Captain Jack Sparrow
**Ship**: *The Black Pearl*
**Personality**: Charismatic trickster, always one step ahead (or one step behind, hard to tell)
**Specialty**: Deception, escapes, finding the impossible
**Motivation**: Freedom, fun, and fortune (in that order)

**Campaign Use**:
- Offers the party a deal that sounds too good to be true (it is, but it works out weirdly)
- Has information about relic locations (gained through absurd luck)
- Owes debts to *everyone* (including the party, eventually)

---
#### 2. Captain Hector Barbossa
**Ship**: *The High Tide*
**Personality**: Ruthless, pragmatic, cunning strategist
**Specialty**: Naval combat, intimidation, long-term planning
**Motivation**: Power, respect, and revenge (against those who wronged them)

**Campaign Use**:
- Rival to Jack Sparrow (constantly scheming)
- Makes hard bargains (keeps their word, but demands a steep price)
- Might betray the party or become their most loyal ally (depending on how they're treated)

---
#### 4. Davy Jones
**Ship**: *The Flying Dutchman** (spectral ship, crewed by undead or cursed sailors)
**Personality**: Tragic, vengeful, bound by a curse
**Specialty**: Fear tactics, spectral combat, knowledge of forbidden magic
**Motivation**: Break their curse (or complete their cursed mission)

**Campaign Use**:
- Quest giver (help them break their curse in exchange for aid)
- Terrifying encounter (if the party crosses them)
- Lore source (they've sailed these seas for centuries)

---
### The Pirate Code (Rules of the Alliance)
1. **Parley**: Any captain (or crew) can demand negotiation before combat (must be honored)
2. **Fair Share**: Treasure is divided among the crew (cheating = mutiny)
3. **Right of Challenge**: Anyone can challenge a captain for command (trial by combat or vote)
4. **Respect the Havens**: No violence in Alliance safe harbors (penalty = exile or death)
5. **No Betrayal of the Alliance**: Snitching to navies = hunted by all pirates
6. **Honor the Vote**: When Pirate Lords vote, the majority rules (even if you disagree)

(Enforcement depends on who you are and who you've angered.)

---
## Pirate Safe Havens (Islands)

### 1. **Skiathos Haven** (Tortuga)
**Description**: Lawless pirate port, taverns, black markets, ship repairs

**Who's There**:
- Pirates of all kinds
- Smugglers, fences, mercenaries
- A few Alliance representatives

**What the Party Can Do**:
- Hire a ship and crew
- Buy/sell contraband
- Gather rumors about relics
- Get into bar fights (inevitably)

**Danger**: No laws = no protection (watch your back)

---
### 2. **The Shipwreck Graveyard** (Hidden Island)

**Description**: Cove filled with wrecked ships (some ancient, some recent), used as a secret meeting place for Pirate Lords

**Who's There**:
- Pirate Lords during major votes
- Scavengers looking for salvage
- Rumored to be haunted

**What the Party Can Do**:
- Attend a Pirate Lord council (if invited)
- Search wrecks for treasure (dangerous: traps, ghosts, curses)
- Witness pirate politics firsthand

**Danger**: Trespassing without invitation = death sentence from the Alliance

---
### 3. Other Havens (Design as Needed)
- A volcanic island with hidden caves
- An island with ancient ruins (relic hunting opportunity)
- A floating market (ships lashed together, no permanent land base)

---
## Naval Mechanics (Using Unearthed Arcana)

### Ship Combat Basics
**Reference**: *Unearthed Arcana: Of Ships and the Sea* (Wizards of the Coast)

**Key Rules**:
- Ships have AC, HP, speed
- Crew actions: Sail, attack (cannons/ballistae), board, repair
- Officers (captain, helmsman, gunner) give bonuses

**Simplified for Play**:
- **Chase scenes**: Contested checks (Helmsman's skill vs. enemy's)
- **Broadsides**: Cannons deal massive damage to ships but are slow to reload
- **Boarding**: When ships are adjacent, melee combat begins

**DM Tip**: Don't bog down every encounter with full ship rules, use them for major battles, simplify for minor ones.

## Pirates & [[the Relic Race]]

### Why Pirates Care About Relics
1. **Treasure value** (relics sell for fortunes)
2. **Leverage** (sell to highest bidder—factions will pay)
3. **Supernatural power** (some pirates want magic for themselves)
4. **Legends** (pirates love becoming legendary)

### How Pirates Interfere
**Scenario 1: Pirate Ambush**
The party is transporting a relic by sea → Pirates attack to steal it.
**Scenario 2: Bidding War**
Pirates captured a relic and auction it to factions (party can outbid or steal it back).
**Scenario 3: Alliance Offer**
Pirate Lords offer the party a ship and crew in exchange for a cut of relic profits.
**Scenario 4: Cursed Treasure**
Pirates stole a relic, got cursed, and beg the party to lift it.

## Adventure Hooks: Pirate Edition

### 1. "The Captain's Bargain"
A charismatic pirate captain (Jack Sparrow) offers the party a map to a relic if they help him settle a score with a rival.
### 2. "Mutiny!"
The party hires a ship, but the crew mutinies mid-voyage. Do they fight, negotiate, or join the mutiny?
### 3. "The Flying Dutchman"
Sailors report seeing *The Flying Dutchman* (cursed pirate ship). Investigate or avoid?
### 4. "Pirate Parley"
The party is invited to a Pirate Lord council. They must navigate politics, duels, and intrigue without a ship to back them up.
### 5. "The Black Market Auction"
A relic appears on the black market in a pirate haven. Factions, pirates, and the party all compete to buy (or steal) it.
### 6. "The Code"
The party accidentally breaks the Pirate Code. Now they're hunted by the Alliance. Can they apologize, fight, or flee?
