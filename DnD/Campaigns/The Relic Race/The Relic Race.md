# Campaign Overview: The Relic Race

## The Premise

**What Happened**: During the events of [[Campaign - The Relic of Alexander|The Relic of Alexander]] one-shot, the party encountered [[High Priest Vasilis]] and the [[Cult of Vasilis (Remnants)|Cult of Vasilis]] that wanted to use [[The Crown of Kings]] to resurrect Darius III.

**What Changed**: The world learned that ancient relics of immense power are **real, accessible, and politically devastating**.

**What Happens Now**: A race begins. Every power (nations, cults, scholars, pirates) seeks these relics for legitimacy, military advantage, or ideological purposes.

---
## Campaign Core Concept

**Title**: *The Relic Race*

**Elevator Pitch**: 
After exposing Alexander's Crown, the party finds themselves at the center of a global competition for ancient artifacts. City-states mobilize fleets. Cults go underground. Scholars debate ethics. Pirates smell profit. The party must navigate alliances, betrayals, and the high seas to control, or destroy, relics that could reshape the world.

**Campaign Length**: Open-ended (designed to continue as long as players enjoy it)

**Starting Level**: 2 (post-one-shot)

---
## The Central Tension

### The Question Driving Everything:
**Who controls the relics, and what do they do with them?**

The party doesn't have to *collect* all relics—they could:
- Ally with a faction and help them win
- Destroy relics to prevent misuse
- Hoard relics for personal power
- Become brokers/neutrals selling to highest bidder
- Start their own faction

**The tension comes from**: Every choice makes enemies. Every ally has ulterior motives. Every relic changes the balance of power.

## How We Got Here (One-Shot Recap)

**The Setup**:
- [[DnD/Campaigns/The Relic Race/NPCs/Dimitris|Dimitris]], a street informant, hired the party to infiltrate the [[Location - Thessaloniki Catacombs|Thessaloniki Catacombs]]
- [[High Priest Vasilis]] wanted [[The Crown of Kings]], claiming it belonged in the [[Cult of Vasilis (Remnants)|Cult of Vasilis]]
- The party discovered [[High Priest Vasilis|Vasilis]] planned to **resurrect Darius III** to "correct history"

**The Outcome**:
-  ??? **The party stopped the ritual** ([[High Priest Vasilis|Vasilis]] was defeated/captured/killed - DM decides based on actual play) ???
- **The Crown's existence became public knowledge**
- **The Cult fractured**??? but didn't disappear

**The Fallout**:
- Thessaloniki's church leadership is embarrassed/suspicious
- Rumors spread: "If Alexander's Crown is real, what else exists?"
- Factions mobilize to search for other relics
- The party has a **reputation** now (good, bad, or both)

## The World After the One-Shot

### Magic & Reality
See [[How Magic Works]] for full details.

**Key Points**:
- Magic is **rare but accepted** (90-95% of people can't cast a cantrip)
- Players are **exceptional**, not world-breaking
- Relics become symbols of legitimacy and military power
- Gods are real but distant (Olympian pantheon + Christian minority)
### Geography
**Setting**: Fantasy medieval Earth with real geography
- **Current Hub**: Thessaloniki, Greece (city-state system)
- **Surrounding Region**: Greek city-states, Aegean Sea, Macedonian territories
- **World Scale**: Full Earth exists & players can travel anywhere
- **Key Locations**: [[Thessaloniki (Hub City)]], [[Skouries & Chalkidiki]], Aegean islands
### Political Structure
- **City-States** dominate Greece
- **Regional Powers** include Macedonian successor kingdoms, maritime republics, distant empires
- **No clear "good guys"**: competing interests with gray morality

## The Four Powers ([[Faction Overview]])

See [[Faction Overview]] for full comparison table.
### 1. [[Northern Power (Macedonian Bloc)]]
**Belief**: Alexander's legacy belongs to Macedonia.
**Goal**: Centralize relics to restore regional dominance.
**Tone**: Nationalistic, strategic, militaristic.
**Threat Level**: High (organized, well-funded).
### 2. [[Maritime City-State]]
**Belief**: Control the seas, control the relics.
**Goal**: Use relics to dominate trade routes and naval power.
**Tone**: Mercantile, pragmatic, opportunistic.
**Threat Level**: Medium-High (powerful navy, wealthy).
### 3. [[Cult of Vasilis (Remnants)]]
**Belief**: History was stolen from the rightful rulers (Persia, others).
**Goal**: Resurrect/restore what was "unjustly taken."
**Tone**: Ideological extremists, intellectual but dangerous.
**Threat Level**: Medium (fractured but obsessive).
**Status Post-One-Shot**: Underground, pursuing the party or pivoting to other relics.
### 4. [[Scholarly Order]]
**Belief**: Relics destabilize the balance of power and magic.
**Goal**: Contain, study, regulate & prevent misuse.
**Tone**: Neutral academics, some are genuinely altruistic, others are controlling.
**Threat Level**: Low-Medium (politically influential, not militarized).

## Campaign Structure (Flexible Arcs)

### Act I: Aftermath & Reputation (Levels 2-4)
**Focus**: Local consequences, faction introductions, early alliances

**Possible Hooks**:
- [[DnD/Campaigns/The Relic Race/NPCs/Dimitris|Dimitris]] offers another job (information gathering)
- Northern Power sends emissaries to recruit the party
- Cult survivors try to steal the Crown or take revenge
- Scholarly Order investigates the party's actions
- Maritime pirates hear about the party and seek them out

**Goal**: Establish the party's stance (which faction, if any, do they align with?)

### Act II: The Race Begins (Levels 5-8)
**Focus**: Exploration, naval adventures, discovering new relics

**Possible Hooks**:
- [[Alexander's Lost Records]] lead to uncharted islands
- Pirates offer the party a ship and crew
- Rival adventuring parties appear (competition)
- First major relic is found by a faction (shifts balance)

**Goal**: Escalate tension, Factions take aggressive action

### Act III: Emergent, Player-Driven
**Focus**: Determined by party choices and faction outcomes

**Potential Directions**:
- **War breaks out** over relic control
- **The party becomes a major power** (build their own faction)
- **Relics are destroyed/sealed**, factions collapse
- **A greater threat emerges** (ancient forces awakened by relic use)

---
## Key Themes & Player Freedom

### Themes to Emphasize
- **Moral Ambiguity**: No faction is purely good or evil
- **Consequences**: Every choice has political/personal fallout
- **Discovery**: Exploration and mystery drive the campaign
- **Power Dynamics**: Relics are leverage, not just loot
### Player Agency
- **The party drives the narrative** (don't railroad)
- **Factions react to party actions** (dynamic world)
- **Multiple solutions to every problem** (combat, diplomacy, stealth, creativity)
- **Failure is interesting** (losing a relic to a faction creates new story)

## Recurring Elements

### The Rumor Mill
Each session, include 2-3 rumors the party can investigate:
- "A merchant claims to have seen Alexander's fleet wreckage near X island"
- "The Northern Power has hired mercenaries preparing for war?"
- "A pirate captain is asking about the party by name"
### [[DnD/Campaigns/The Relic Race/NPCs/Dimitris|Dimitris]]'s Network
[[DnD/Campaigns/The Relic Race/NPCs/Dimitris|Dimitris]] becomes a recurring contact:
- Pays the party for information
- Offers jobs (some legitimate, some morally gray)
- Has connections to multiple factions (neutral broker)
- Can be a lifeline when the party needs to disappear
### The Crown's Status
**Decision Point**: What happened to [[The Crown of Kings]]?
Options:
1. **Party has it** → Factions hunt them
2. **Party hid it** → Everyone searches for it
3. **Party gave it to a faction** → That faction gains power
4. **Party destroyed it** → Scholarly Order respects them, others hate them
This decision shapes early campaign dynamics.

## DM Flexibility Notes

### What to Prep, What to Improvise
**Prep**:
- Faction goals and motivations (consistent personalities)
- 2-3 hooks per session (player choice determines which)
- Key NPC personalities and speech patterns
**Improvise**:
- Exact plot outcomes (let players surprise you)
- Minor NPCs and locations (use real geography)
- Relic locations (you don't need to design all relics upfront)
### Handling the Unexpected
**If players go off-map**:
- Use real-world geography (they want to go to Egypt? Italy? Spain? Do it!)
- Every region has factions, relics, and conflicts
- Reskin prepared content to new locations
**If players refuse faction alignment**:
- Let them become independent (harder but possible)
- Factions view them as wildcards (some hire them, some hunt them)
- This is a valid playstyle but lean into it
