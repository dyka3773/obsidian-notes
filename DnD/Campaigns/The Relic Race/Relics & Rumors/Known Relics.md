# Known Relics

A catalog of confirmed and rumored relics in *The Relic Race* campaign.

---

## Overview

**What Are Relics?**
Legendary artifacts from history—powerful, rare, and politically significant.

**Why They Matter**:
- **Symbols of legitimacy** ("I have Alexander's Crown; I am his successor")
- **Military advantages** (one relic can equal 1,000 soldiers)
- **Divine curiosities** (proof of myths and legends)
- **Political leverage** (nations trade land, wealth, or alliances for them)

**Campaign Philosophy**:
You don't need to predefine every relic. Let **rumors** drive the story—if players hear about an artifact, *then* you design it.

## Designing New Relics (DM Toolkit)

When the party hears a rumor, create the relic using this framework:

### Step 1: Choose Historical/Mythological Source
- Real historical artifacts (Crown of Kings, Disc of Phaistos)
- Greek mythology (Trident of Poseidon, Lyre of Orpheus)
- Persian/Egyptian/Roman sources (expand beyond Greece)

### Step 2: Assign Power Level
- **Rare**: +1 weapon, minor magical effect (single spell once per day)
- **Very Rare**: +2 weapon, moderate effects (2-3 spells, combat advantages)
- **Legendary**: +3 weapon, game-changing powers (reshape battles, political leverage)

### Step 3: Add a Cost or Curse
Powerful relics should have drawbacks:
- The Crown corrupts the wearer
- Poseidon's Trident requires a sacrifice to the sea
- The Lyre attracts undead (Orpheus's underworld connection)

### Step 4: Make It Contested
Multiple factions want the same relic (creates conflict):
- Who has it now?
- Who's trying to steal it?
- What happens if the party gets it?

---

## Relic Rumors (Session Hooks)

Use these as random rumors the party hears in taverns, from [[Dimitris]], or from scholars:

1. *"A fisherman pulled up a strange trident in his nets. He sold it to a merchant—now that merchant is missing."*
2. *"Olympian priests say they've received a vision: the Shield of Achilles has been found in Troy."*
3. *"Pirates are auctioning a golden fleece they claim came from a dragon's hoard. Real or fake?"*
4. *"A Durmstrang scholar arrived in Thessaloniki asking about 'Alexander's lost fleet.' What's he looking for?"*
5. *"The Cult of Vasilis is hiring mercenaries for an expedition to Persia. What are they after?"*

## Using Relics in Combat

### Legendary Relic Effects (In Player Hands)

If the party wields a relic in battle:
- **Morale Impact**: Enemies may flee (or fight harder to claim it)
- **Faction Attention**: Using a relic publicly draws faction agents
- **NPC Reactions**: Allies are inspired, enemies are terrified

### Legendary Relic Effects (In Villain Hands)

If a faction leader wields a relic:
- **Boss Fight Enhancement**: Add lair actions or legendary actions
- **Narrative Weight**: The villain's speech references the relic's power
- **Defeat Opportunity**: Stealing/destroying the relic weakens the villain

## Campaign Tracking: Relic Status

Use this table to track relic locations:

| Relic | Current Location | Owner | Factions Pursuing | Party Status |

## DM Notes: Relic Campaign Pacing

### Early Campaign (Levels 2-4)
- **1-2 relics** in play (Crown + 1 rumored)
- Focus on factions competing for the Crown
- Introduce rumors about others

### Mid Campaign (Levels 5-8)
- **3-5 relics** discovered or pursued
- Party has choices (which relic to pursue?)
- Factions gain or lose relics (power shifts)

### Late Campaign (Levels 9+)
- **Major relics** are in play (Trident, Thunderbolt, etc.)
- Factions use relics in open conflict
- Party decides the fate of relics (hoard, destroy, distribute?)
