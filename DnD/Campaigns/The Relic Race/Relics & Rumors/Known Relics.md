# Known Relics

A catalog of confirmed and rumored relics in *[[The Relic Race]]* campaign.

---
## Overview

**What Are Relics?**
Legendary artifacts from history, powerful, rare, and politically significant.

**Why They Matter**:
- **Symbols of legitimacy** ("I have Alexander's Crown --> I am his successor")
- **Military advantages** (one relic can equal 1,000 soldiers)
- **Divine curiosities** (proof of myths and legends)
- **Political leverage** (nations trade land, wealth, or alliances for them)

**Campaign Philosophy**:
You don't need to predefine every relic. Let **rumors** drive the story, if players hear about an artifact, *then* you design it.

## Confirmed Relics (The Party Knows These Exist)

### [[The Crown of Kings]]

**Full Details**: See [[The Crown of Kings]] (one-shot loot file)

**Owner**: Alexander the Great (historical)
**Current Status**: [DM determines based on one-shot outcome]
- Option 1: Party has it
- Option 2: Party hid it
- Option 3: Party gave it to a faction
- Option 4: Party destroyed it

**Powers** (Summary):
- **[[Command]] Dominion**: Force obedience from those nearby (legendary Charisma)
- **Summon Loyalty**: Compel soldiers to fight for you
- **Reality Warping**: Reshape minor aspects of the world (very limited)
- **Corruption**: Over time, the wearer becomes tyrannical

**Campaign Significance**: The Crown is the **catalyst** for [[the Relic Race]]. Its discovery proved relics are real.

## Rumored Relics (Hooks for Adventures)

These are **not** fully designed yet. Create stats when the party pursues them.

### The Shield of Achilles

**Rumor**: 
*"Hephaestus forged a shield for Achilles that depicted the entire world. Whoever holds it is protected not just by metal, but by the cosmos itself."*

**Possible Location**:
- Troy (ruins, if the party travels to Turkey)
- A museum or noble's collection (stolen from an archaeological site)
- In the possession of a Greek hero's descendant

**Possible Powers**:
- +3 shield, grants [[resistance]] to all damage types (for 1 minute, once per day)
- **Reflection**: Spells targeting you can be reflected back at the caster
- **Cosmic Awareness**: Once per day, ask a question about the world (like *[[Legend Lore]]*)

**Factions Interested**:
- [[Scholarly Order]]: Wants to study its cosmic properties
- [[Northern Power (Macedonian Bloc)]]: Military advantage

**Adventure Hook**: 
The party hears that a noble family in Athens has the Shield, but it's guarded heavily, and factions are already plotting to steal it.

### The Disc of Phaistos (Deciphered)

**Rumor**: 
*"An ancient Minoan artifact, covered in undeciphered symbols. Scholars believe it's a map—or a key to something far older than Greece itself."*

**Possible Location**:
- Crete (Minoan ruins, real-world site: Knossos)
- A private collector's vault
- Lost at sea, recently recovered

**Possible Powers** (when deciphered):
- **Map to a Lost Civilization**: Reveals location of a pre-Greek empire (Atlantis? Minoan treasure vaults?)
- **Key**: Opens a sealed tomb or vault
- **Prophecy**: Reveals a cryptic future event

**Factions Interested**:
- [[Scholarly Order]]: Archaeological prize
- [[Maritime City-State]]: Could lead to naval treasures
- Anyone seeking ancient knowledge

**Adventure Hook**: 
The party is hired to escort a scholar to Crete. She claims she's decoded the Disc.

### The Trident of Poseidon

**Rumor**: 
*"Poseidon's weapon, said to command the seas, summon storms, and split the earth. Some say it rests in his temple beneath the waves."*

**Possible Location**:
- Underwater temple (Aegean Sea)
- Atlantis (if you want to introduce a sunken civilization)
- Held by a sea monster (guardian)

**Possible Powers**:
- +3 magical trident, deals extra damage to aquatic creatures
- **Commanding the Seas**: Cast *[[Control Water]]* and *[[Control Weather]]* (once per day each)
- **Aquatic Supremacy**: Breathe underwater, swim speed 60 ft, communicate with sea creatures

**Factions Interested**:
- [[Maritime City-State]]: Absolute naval dominance
- Pirates (Pirate Lords would go to war for this)
- Coastal city-states

**Adventure Hook**: 
Sailors report an island that "wasn't there before." An oracle says Poseidon's temple has risen from the sea.

### The Golden Fleece

**Rumor**: 
*"Jason and the Argonauts retrieved it from Colchis. It granted kingship and protection to whoever possessed it. After Jason's death, it vanished."*

**Possible Location**:
- Colchis (real-world Georgia, eastern Black Sea)
- Stolen and hidden by a dragon (classic fantasy)
- A temple in Thessaloniki (brought back and forgotten)

**Possible Powers**:
- **Healing**: Creatures within 10 feet of the Fleece regain 1d6 HP at the start of their turn
- **Legitimacy**: Advantage on Persuasion checks when negotiating with nobles/leaders
- **Protection**: Grants [[resistance]] to fire and poison

**Factions Interested**:
- [[Northern Power (Macedonian Bloc)]]: Symbol of rightful kingship
- Any faction seeking legitimacy

**Adventure Hook**: 
A merchant claims to have seen the Fleece in a dragon's hoard. The party must decide: fight the dragon or negotiate?

### Darius III's Scepter (Counterpart to the Crown)

**Rumor**: 
*"If Alexander's Crown exists, so does Darius's Scepter—the Persian symbol of kingship. Together, they could rewrite history."*

**Possible Location**:
- Persia (modern-day Iran)
- Stolen after Darius's defeat, hidden by loyalists
- In the possession of [[Cult of Vasilis (Remnants)]]

**Possible Powers**:
- **Rival to the Crown**: When wielded together, the Crown and Scepter grant immense power—but the wielder must choose one ideology (Greek or Persian)
- **[[Command]] Armies**: Like the Crown, but tied to Persian legacy
- **[[Resurrection]] Ritual**: Required component to resurrect Darius III

**Factions Interested**:
- [[Cult of Vasilis (Remnants)]]: Essential for their goals
- [[Northern Power (Macedonian Bloc)]]: Wants to destroy it
- [[Scholarly Order]]: Fascinated by the Crown-Scepter dynamic

**Adventure Hook**: 
The party learns the Cult is searching for the Scepter in Persia. Do they stop them or race to find it first?

## Designing New Relics (DM Toolkit)

When the party hears a rumor, create the relic using this framework:
### Step 1: Choose Historical/Mythological Source
- Real historical artifacts (Crown of Kings, Disc of Phaistos)
- Greek mythology (Trident of Poseidon, Lyre of Orpheus)
- Persian/Egyptian/Roman sources (expand beyond Greece)
### Step 2: Assign Power Level
- **Rare**: +1 weapon, minor magical effect (single spell once per day)
- **Very Rare**: +2 weapon, moderate effects (2-3 spells, combat advantages)
- **Legendary**: +3 weapon, game-changing powers (reshape battles, political leverage)
### Step 3: Add a Cost or Curse
Powerful relics should have drawbacks:
- The Crown corrupts the wearer
- Poseidon's Trident requires a sacrifice to the sea
- The Lyre attracts undead (Orpheus's underworld connection)
### Step 4: Make It Contested
Multiple factions want the same relic (creates conflict):
- Who has it now?
- Who's trying to steal it?
- What happens if the party gets it?

---
## Relic Rumors (Session Hooks)
Use these as random rumors the party hears in taverns, from [[DnD/Campaigns/Your First One-Shot/NPCs/Dimitris|Dimitris]], or from scholars:
1. *"A fisherman pulled up a strange trident in his nets. He sold it to a merchant—now that merchant is missing."*
2. *"Olympian priests say they've received a vision: the Shield of Achilles has been found in Troy."*
3. *"Pirates are auctioning a golden fleece they claim came from a dragon's hoard. Real or fake?"*
4. *"A Durmstrang scholar arrived in Thessaloniki asking about 'Alexander's lost fleet.' What's he looking for?"*
5. *"The Cult of [[High Priest Vasilis|Vasilis]] is hiring mercenaries for an expedition to Persia. What are they after?"*

## Using Relics in Combat

### Legendary Relic Effects (In Player Hands)
If the party wields a relic in battle:
- **Morale Impact**: Enemies may flee (or fight harder to claim it)
- **Faction Attention**: Using a relic publicly draws faction agents
- **NPC Reactions**: Allies are inspired, enemies are terrified
### Legendary Relic Effects (In Villain Hands)
If a faction leader wields a relic:
- **Boss Fight Enhancement**: Add lair actions or legendary actions
- **Narrative Weight**: The villain's speech references the relic's power
- **Defeat Opportunity**: Stealing/destroying the relic weakens the villain

- Party has choices (which relic to pursue?)
- Factions gain or lose relics (power shifts)
### Late Campaign (Levels 9+)
- **Major relics** are in play (Trident, Thunderbolt, etc.)
- Factions use relics in open conflict
- Party decides the fate of relics (hoard, destroy, distribute?)
