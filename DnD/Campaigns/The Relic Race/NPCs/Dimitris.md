## Background

### Before the One-Shot
- Grew up in Thessaloniki's slums
- Learned early: information is more valuable than muscle
- Built a network of contacts (sailors, smugglers, low-level cultists, corrupt guards)
- Operates in moral gray zones (not a villain, not a hero)
### During the One-Shot
- Hired the party to infiltrate the catacombs (on behalf of [[High Priest Vasilis]])
- Likely didn't know [[High Priest Vasilis|Vasilis]]'s true intentions (or didn't care)
- Paid the party as promised (established credibility)
### Post-One-Shot Status
**Key Question**: Was [[DnD/Campaigns/Your First One-Shot/NPCs/Dimitris|Dimitris]] complicit in [[High Priest Vasilis|Vasilis]]'s plan?

**Answer**: **No** (recommended interpretation for campaign use)
- He was a middleman (hired to find capable people)
- He didn't ask questions (plausible deniability)
- When the truth came out, he likely felt *relieved* ([[High Priest Vasilis|Vasilis]]'s failure doesn't implicate him)

**This makes him a useful recurring NPC** (not an enemy, but not entirely trustworthy).

## Dialogue Examples

## DM Notes: Using [[DnD/Campaigns/Your First One-Shot/NPCs/Dimitris|Dimitris]]

### When to Use Him
- **Between adventures** (he approaches the party with a new job)
- **When the party needs information** (they seek him out)
- **To introduce faction representatives** (he brokers meetings)
- **As a moral compass check** (his pragmatism highlights the party's choices)
### When NOT to Overuse Him
- Don't make him the party's only contact (diversify NPCs)
- Don't force him into every session (he's a tool, not a main character)
- Don't make him betray the party *unless* they give him a reason (he's reliable within his limits)
### Evolving the Relationship
**If the party treats him well**:
- He offers better deals (discounts, exclusive information)
- He warns them about dangers (even if it's not profitable)
- He might call in a favor (but it's reasonable)
**If the party treats him poorly**:
- He raises prices (trust tax)
- He withholds critical information
- He eventually cuts them off
**If the party becomes powerful**:
- [[DnD/Campaigns/Your First One-Shot/NPCs/Dimitris|Dimitris]] wants to stay on their good side (they're influential now)
- He might ask them to protect him from a faction
- He could become a loyal ally (rare, but possible)
