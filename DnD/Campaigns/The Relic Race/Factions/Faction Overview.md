# Faction Overview: The Four Powers

A quick-reference guide to the major factions competing in the Relic Race.

---
## At-a-Glance Comparison

| Faction | Core Belief | Primary Goal | Resources | Disposition | Threat Level |
|---------|-------------|--------------|-----------|-------------|--------------|
| **[[Northern Power (Macedonian Bloc)]]** | Alexander's legacy belongs to Macedonia | Centralize relics to restore dominance | Military, political legitimacy | Nationalistic, strategic | **High** |
| **[[Maritime City-State]]** | Control seas = control relics | Dominate trade routes using relic power | Navy, wealth, trade network | Pragmatic, opportunistic | **High** |
| **[[Cult of Vasilis (Remnants)]]** | History was stolen from rightful rulers | Resurrect/restore what was taken | Zealots, hidden cells, obsession | Ideological extremists | **Medium** |
| **[[Scholarly Order]]** | Relics destabilize magic/power balance | Contain, study, regulate relics | Knowledge, political influence | Neutral academics | **Medium** |
## Faction Details

### [[Northern Power (Macedonian Bloc)]]

**Leadership**: [To be designed - likely a council of generals/nobles]

**Motivation**: 
"Alexander was Macedonian. His relics belong to his homeland. Reuniting them proves we are the rightful successors to his empire."

**Tactics**:
- Military expeditions to relic sites
- Diplomatic pressure on city-states
- Recruiting adventurers and scholars
- Propaganda campaigns ("Restore Macedonian glory")

**What They Offer the Party**:
- Gold, military support, titles/land
- Access to Alexander's historical archives
- Protection from other factions

**What They Want from the Party**:
- Retrieve relics
- Intelligence on rival factions
- Loyalty (they don't like double agents)

**How They React to Opposition**:
- Diplomatic pressure first
- Economic sanctions second
- Military action if needed (they're not reckless, but they're powerful)

---
### [[Maritime City-State]]

**Leadership**: [To be designed - likely a merchant prince or naval admiral]

**Motivation**:
"Relics aren't about history. They're about power. The future belongs to whoever controls the seas. We'll take that future."

**Tactics**:
- Naval blockades and sea patrol
- Hiring pirates as privateers
- Bankrolling expeditions
- Controlling trade routes to relic-rich regions

**What They Offer the Party**:
- A ship and crew
- Trade connections and smuggling routes
- Wealth (they pay *very* well)
- Freedom to operate (less ideological than Northern Power)

**What They Want from the Party**:
- Secure relics before rivals
- Disrupt enemy supply lines
- Establish trade outposts at relic sites

**How They React to Opposition**:
- Economic warfare (cut off supplies, bribe competitors)
- Pirate attacks (plausible deniability)
- Rarely direct military confrontation (prefer proxies)

---
### [[Cult of Vasilis (Remnants)]]

**Leadership**: [[High Priest Vasilis]] (deceased/imprisoned/fled - DM decides based on one-shot outcome)
- If Vasilis died: **A successor emerges** (fanatical, smarter, or more desperate)
- If Vasilis fled: **He leads from hiding** (obsessed with revenge)

**Motivation**:
"History is written by victors. Alexander conquered, but Darius was the rightful ruler. We will correct this injustice."

**Tactics** (Post-One-Shot):
- **Underground cells**: No longer centralized, harder to track
- **Assassinations**: Target party members or rival leaders
- **Relic sabotage**: If they can't have it, no one can
- **Recruitment**: Find others who feel "wronged by history"

**What They Offer the Party**:
- Ancient knowledge (they're historians and scholars)
- Fanatical loyalty if the party shares their goals
- Access to hidden sites (they've researched Alexander's enemies)

**What They Want from the Party**:
- **Revenge** (if party stopped them in one-shot)
- **The Crown** (obsessively, if party has it)
- **Other relics** tied to Alexander's enemies (Darius, Persian artifacts)

**How They React to Opposition**:
- **Persistent**: They don't give up
- **Desperate**: Willing to sacrifice themselves
- **Creative**: Use blackmail, leverage, manipulation

**Party Hook**: Dimitris might have information on Cult hideouts (for a price).

### [[Scholarly Order]]

**Leadership**: [To be designed - likely a council of archmages and historians]

**Motivation**:
"Relics are forces of chaos. Unchecked, they tip balances magically, politically, militarily. Our duty is to preserve equilibrium."

**Tactics**:
- Academic study of relic effects
- Lobbying city-states to regulate relic trade
- Secret vaults to store dangerous artifacts
- Hiring adventurers to *contain* relics, not use them

**What They Offer the Party**:
- Knowledge (identify relics, translate texts, historical context)
- Safe storage (party can deposit relics they don't want to carry)
- Neutrality (won't force the party into conflicts)
- Ethical justification ("You're preventing catastrophe")

**What They Want from the Party**:
- Bring relics to them for study (they'll "borrow" them)
- Prevent relics from reaching warlords or zealots
- Report relic locations (they decide what to do next)

**How They React to Opposition**:
- Debate and persuasion first
- Political maneuvering second
- Rarely violence (they'll hire others for that)

**Moral Question**: Are they genuinely trying to prevent disaster, or are they hoarding power under the guise of "protecting balance"?

## How Factions Learn About Relics

### Intelligence Networks
- **Northern Power**: Spies in museums, monasteries, archives
- **Maritime State**: Sailors, merchants, port gossips
- **Cult**: Historical research, ancient texts, zealot investigators
- **Scholarly Order**: Academic journals, peer networks, magical divination
### The Rumor Mill
When the party finds a relic, news spreads at different speeds:
- **Publicly used**: Everyone knows within days
- **Secretly acquired**: Factions learn through espionage (1-2 weeks)
- **Hidden/destroyed**: Factions suspect but can't confirm

---
## Faction Progression (How They Evolve)

### Based on Party Actions
**If party aligns with a faction**:
- That faction grows stronger (more resources, confidence)
- Other factions view party as enemies or potential turncoats

**If party stays independent**:
- All factions try to recruit or eliminate them
- Party becomes a wildcard (feared and valuable)

**If party destroys relics**:
- Scholarly Order respects them
- Warriors and zealots view them as obstacles

## Quick Reference: Faction First Contact

### How Each Faction Approaches the Party First Time
**Northern Power**: 
*"Your deeds in Thessaloniki have reached our ears. The Macedonian legacy is at stake. Join us, and you'll be remembered as heroes."*
**Maritime State**: 
*"You've got talent. We've got gold and a ship. Interested in a mutually profitable arrangement?"*
**Cult of Vasilis**: 
*Depends on one-shot outcome—either revenge attack or desperate recruitment attempt.*
**Scholarly Order**: 
*"We've been studying the Crown's effects. We'd like to discuss… containment. And compensation, of course."*
