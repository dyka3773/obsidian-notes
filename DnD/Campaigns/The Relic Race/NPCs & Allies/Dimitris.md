**Voice**: Smooth, measured, occasionally sarcastic

---
## Personality

- **Reliable (Within Limits)**: Keeps his word on deals. Reputation is currency
- **Amoral, Not Evil**: Doesn't care about good vs. evil, just business

- Refuses to give information for free (even to friends)
- Has an escape route from every location he frequents

---
## Background

### Before the One-Shot
- Grew up in Thessaloniki's slums
- Learned early: information is more valuable than muscle
- Built a network of contacts (sailors, smugglers, low-level cultists, corrupt guards)
- Operates in moral gray zones (not a villain, not a hero)
### During the One-Shot
- Hired the party to infiltrate the catacombs (on behalf of [[High Priest Vasilis]])
- Likely didn't know Vasilis's true intentions (or didn't care)
- Paid the party as promised (established credibility)
### Post-One-Shot Status
**Key Question**: Was Dimitris complicit in Vasilis's plan?

**Answer**: **No** (recommended interpretation for campaign use)
- He was a middleman (hired to find capable people)
- He didn't ask questions (plausible deniability)
- When the truth came out, he likely felt *relieved* (Vasilis's failure doesn't implicate him)

**This makes him a useful recurring NPC** (not an enemy, but not entirely trustworthy).

## Relationships

### With the Party
- **Initial**: Neutral (transactional)
- **If treated well**: Friendly (offers better deals, warns them of danger)
- **If betrayed**: Hostile (cuts them off from his network, might sell information *about* them)

### With Factions
- **[[Northern Power (Macedonian Bloc)]]**: Has low-level contacts, but not aligned
- **[[Maritime City-State]]**: Works with smugglers tied to them
- **[[Cult of Vasilis (Remnants)]]**: Knows where some members hide (but won't help them)
- **[[Scholarly Order]]**: Occasionally sells information to scholars

**Key Point**: Dimitris doesn't take sides—he sells to everyone.

## Dialogue Examples

### When Hiring the Party
*"I've got a job. It's dangerous, probably illegal, and definitely profitable. Interested?"*

### When Negotiating Price
*"I'm a businessman, not a charity. You want information? I want gold. Simple as that."*

### When Warning the Party
*"Listen, I like you. You're good for business. So here's free advice: leave town for a few days. Trust me."*

### When Refusing a Job
*"No amount of gold is worth dying over. Find someone else to poke that hornet's nest."*

### When the Party Betrays Him
*"You broke the only rule that matters: trust. We're done. Don't come back."*

## DM Notes: Using Dimitris

### When to Use Him
- **Between adventures** (he approaches the party with a new job)
- **When the party needs information** (they seek him out)
- **To introduce faction representatives** (he brokers meetings)
- **As a moral compass check** (his pragmatism highlights the party's choices)

### When NOT to Overuse Him
- Don't make him the party's only contact (diversify NPCs)
- Don't force him into every session (he's a tool, not a main character)
- Don't make him betray the party *unless* they give him a reason (he's reliable within his limits)

### Evolving the Relationship
**If the party treats him well**:
- He offers better deals (discounts, exclusive information)
- He warns them about dangers (even if it's not profitable)
- He might call in a favor (but it's reasonable)

**If the party treats him poorly**:
- He raises prices (trust tax)
- He withholds critical information
- He eventually cuts them off

**If the party becomes powerful**:
- Dimitris wants to stay on their good side (they're influential now)
- He might ask them to protect him from a faction
- He could become a loyal ally (rare, but possible)

## Adventure Hooks: Dimitris in Danger

### 1. "The Hit"
A faction puts a price on Dimitris's head (he knows too much). He begs the party to protect him.

### 2. "The Betrayal"
Dimitris is arrested (for smuggling or espionage). The party must decide: rescue him, let him rot, or use him as leverage?

### 3. "The Rival"
A rival information broker moves into Thessaloniki. Dimitris hires the party to "convince" them to leave.

### 4. "The Debt"
Dimitris owes money to dangerous people (pirates or a crime lord). He needs the party's help to pay or fight his way out.
