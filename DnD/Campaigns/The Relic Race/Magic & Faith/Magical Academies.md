- Warding and protective magic
- Historical research

**Size**: Small (20-30 students per year)

**Cultural Notes**:

- Faculty could be allies or rivals depending on faction alignment

---
### 📚 Thessaloniki Collegiate of Magic

**Location**: Thessaloniki, Greece

**Reputation**: Practical, newer, less prestigious than Athens

**Specializations**:
- Applied magic (artifice, enchantment for trade goods)
- Naval and weather magic (port city influence)
- Cross-cultural studies (Christian and Olympian magic coexist here)

**Size**: Small (similar to Athens)

**Cultural Notes**:
- Founded ~200 years ago (new by European standards)
- More open to non-traditional students (women, foreigners, commoners)
- Viewed as "the upstart school" by Athenian mages

**Campaign Use**:
- **The party is local!** This school could be a resource
- Library access, NPC contacts, safe haven
- Faculty might approach party for relic information

---
### Other Academies (Designed as Needed)

**Framework**: If the party travels to a new country, assume it has **one major academy** (if it's large/wealthy enough).

Example templates:
- **Italian Academy** (Rome or Venice): Focused on political magic and illusion
- **Spanish Academy** (Toledo): Mix of Christian and Islamic magical traditions
- **Egyptian Academy** (Alexandria): Ancient traditions, necromancy, divine magic

We'll design these **only if the party goes there**.

---
## Non-Academy Magic Training

### Apprenticeships (Most Common)

**How it works**:
- A wizard takes on 1-2 students at a time
- Training lasts 5-10 years
- Student learns their master's specialty

**Examples**:
- [[Ornn|Master Ornn]] trains artificers (like the party's dwarf)
- Court mages train successors
- Hermit wizards in towers take promising youths

**Cultural View**:
- Just as respected as academy education
- More personalized, but less prestigious network

---
### Self-Taught (Rare)

**Who does this**:
- Sorcerers (innate power, no teacher needed)
- Desperate individuals who find spellbooks
- Hermits or outcasts

**Risks**:
- No oversight (easy to make catastrophic mistakes)
- Socially isolated (no network or mentorship)
- Viewed as dangerous by established mages

---
### Military Training (Specialized)

**Where it happens**:
- National armies train war mages
- [[Northern Power (Macedonian Bloc)]] has battle-mage academies

**Focus**:
- Combat magic only ([[Fireball]], [[Shield]], [[Counterspell]])
- Tactics and unit coordination
- No theoretical or philosophical training

**Cultural View**:
- Respected for utility, not intellectualism
- "Wands for hire"

## Academy Resources for Players

### What the Party Can Access

**If they visit an academy**:
1. **Library** (historical research on relics)
   - Requires: Permission (letter of introduction, faction backing, or reputation)
   - Benefit: Learn relic lore, [[identify]] artifacts, translate ancient texts

2. **Faculty Expertise** (consultations)
   - Requires: Payment (50-500 gp depending on complexity)
   - Benefit: [[Identify]] magic items, analyze relic effects, commission enchantments

3. **Spell Scrolls & Components** (shop)
   - Requires: Gold
   - Benefit: Buy uncommon scrolls, rare components

4. **Sanctuary** (safe haven)
   - Requires: Good reputation with that academy
   - Benefit: Rest without fear of faction attacks (academies are neutral ground)
### What the Party Cannot Access
- **Forbidden knowledge** without permission (Durmstrang's dark arts section, etc.)
- **Teleportation circles** (too valuable, restricted to faculty)
- **Artifact vaults** (academies store dangerous relics that are heavily warded)

---
## Campaign Hooks Involving Academies

### 1. "The Scholar's Plea"
A Thessaloniki professor hires the party to retrieve a relic before a rival faction does. She promises academic support in return.
### 2. "The Durmstrang Mercenary"
A Durmstrang graduate is hired by [[Cult of Vasilis (Remnants)]] to hunt the party. Encounter = combat + moral question (does he question his orders?).
### 3. "The Athenian Rivalry"
Athenian Academy sends representatives to Thessaloniki, demanding the party surrender relics "for proper study." They're condescending. Party must navigate politics.
### 4. "The Hogwarts Alumni Network"
A British diplomat (Hogwarts graduate) offers the party a deal: information on a relic in exchange for escorting supplies to a dangerous region.
### 5. "The Forbidden Tome"
The party learns of a book in Durmstrang's library that contains relic [[resurrection]] rituals (like the one [[High Priest Vasilis|Vasilis]] attempted). Do they steal it, buy it, or let it be?

---
## Magic Schools in Other Regions (Framework)

When the party travels, use this template:
### [Country] Academy of [Magic Type]
**Location**: [City]
**Reputation**: [What they're known for]
**Specialization**: [1-2 magical focuses]
**Political Alignment**: [Neutral, aligned with a faction, independent]
**What They Offer the Party**: [Library, faculty, sanctuary, etc.]

**Example (if party goes to Egypt)**:
### Alexandrian Institute of the Arcane
**Location**: Alexandria, Egypt
**Reputation**: Ancient traditions, necromancy, divine magic
**Specialization**: Death magic (regulated), oracle training
**Political Alignment**: Independent but courted by all factions
**What They Offer the Party**: Unparalleled historical records, access to Egyptian relics

---
## DM Notes: Balancing Academy Presence

### Don't Overuse Them
- Academies should feel **special** when encountered
- They're not quest hubs, they're resources
- Too much access = magic feels less rare
### Make Them Politically Neutral (Mostly)
- Academies don't take sides in [[the Relic Race]] (officially)
- Individual faculty might have opinions, but institutions stay neutral
- This makes them safe havens and neutral meeting grounds
### Use Alumni as NPCs
- Instead of visiting the academy itself, introduce graduates
- Ally: A Beauxbatons enchanter hires the party
- Rival: A Durmstrang mercenary hunts them
- Contact: A Hogwarts diplomat offers information
