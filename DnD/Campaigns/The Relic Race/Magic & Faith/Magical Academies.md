# Magical Academies

A guide to wizarding schools and arcane institutions in *The Relic Race* world.

---

## Overview

**Key Principle**: Magic academies exist, are known, but are **elite and selective**.

Think of them like prestigious universities:
- Everyone's heard of Harvard, Oxford, or the Sorbonne
- Very few people attend
- Graduates are respected and valuable
- Competition for admission is fierce

**In this world**:
- ~1 academy per major country/region (geographically)
- **The Famous Three** (Europe): Hogwarts, Beauxbatons, Durmstrang
- Smaller regional academies exist but aren't world-renowned
- Most wizards learn through **private tutoring** or **apprenticeships** (academies are expensive)

---

## The Famous Three (European Academies)

### 🏰 Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry

**Location**: Scotland (Britain)

**Reputation**: Tradition, rigorous curriculum, produces well-rounded mages

**Specializations**:
- Balanced education (combat, utility, theory)
- Strong emphasis on magical history and ethics
- Known for producing diplomats and court mages

**Admission**:
- Invitation-based (magical talent detected at birth or youth)
- No tuition (funded by British noble houses)
- Highly selective (hundreds apply, dozens admitted per year)

**Cultural Notes**:
- Most structured of the three schools
- Graduates are respected in political circles
- Alumni network is powerful across Europe

**Faculty**:
- Headmaster: [TBD if party visits]
- Mix of Olympian and Christian wizards (secular institution)

**Campaign Use**:

- Hogwarts alumni might become NPCs (rivals, allies, or contacts)
- Library contains historical records about relics

---

### 🌹 Beauxbatons Academy of Magic

**Location**: Southern France (Pyrenees region)

**Reputation**: Elegance, refinement, artistic magic

**Specializations**:
- Enchantment and illusion magic

---

### ⚔️ Durmstrang Institute

**Location**: Northern Europe (Scandinavia, exact location secret)

**Reputation**: Martial magic, pragmatic, controversial

**Specializations**:
- Combat magic and battle tactics
- Darker/forbidden studies (necromancy, curses—regulated but explored)
- Survival and elemental magic (harsh northern environment)

**Admission**:
- Merit-based (prove you're tough enough)
- Physically demanding trials
- Accepts students other schools reject for being "too aggressive"

**Cultural Notes**:

- Viewed with suspicion by southern Europeans (too willing to explore "dark arts")
- Strong sense of loyalty among alumni

**Faculty**:
- Headmaster: [TBD if party visits]
- Former warlords, ex-mercenaries, pragmatic scholars

**Campaign Use**:
- Durmstrang graduates might be faction enforcers
- Party could encounter rivals trained here (combat-focused)
- Library has forbidden knowledge about relics (but access is restricted)

---

## Regional Academies (Lesser Known)

### 🏛️ Athenian Academy of the Arcane

**Location**: Athens, Greece

**Reputation**: Philosophical magic, tied to Olympian traditions

**Specializations**:
- Divination and prophecy (works with oracles)
- Warding and protective magic
- Historical research

**Size**: Small (20-30 students per year)

**Cultural Notes**:
- Affiliated with temples of Athena and Apollo
- Very traditional (resistant to new magical theory)
- Thessaloniki's academy is seen as its rival (less prestigious but more innovative)

**Campaign Use**:
- Party might visit for research on Alexander's relics
- Faculty could be allies or rivals depending on faction alignment

---

### 📚 Thessaloniki Collegiate of Magic

**Location**: Thessaloniki, Greece (the party's starting city!)

**Reputation**: Practical, newer, less prestigious than Athens

**Specializations**:
- Applied magic (artifice, enchantment for trade goods)
- Naval and weather magic (port city influence)
- Cross-cultural studies (Christian and Olympian magic coexist here)

**Size**: Small (similar to Athens)

**Cultural Notes**:
- Founded ~200 years ago (new by European standards)
- More open to non-traditional students (women, foreigners, commoners)
- Viewed as "the upstart school" by Athenian mages

**Faculty**:
- Headmaster: [TBD - could be a recurring NPC for the party]
- Mix of practical instructors and exiled Athenian professors

**Campaign Use**:
- **The party is local!** This school could be a resource
- Library access, NPC contacts, safe haven
- Faculty might approach party for relic information

---

### Other Academies (Designed as Needed)

**Framework**: If the party travels to a new country, assume it has **one major academy** (if it's large/wealthy enough).

Example templates:
- **Italian Academy** (Rome or Venice): Focused on political magic and illusion
- **Spanish Academy** (Toledo): Mix of Christian and Islamic magical traditions
- **Egyptian Academy** (Alexandria): Ancient traditions, necromancy, divine magic

We'll design these **only if the party goes there**.

---

## Non-Academy Magic Training

### Apprenticeships (Most Common)

**How it works**:
- A wizard takes on 1-2 students at a time
- Training lasts 5-10 years
- Student learns their master's specialty

**Examples**:
- [[Master Ornn]] trains artificers (like the party's dwarf)
- Court mages train successors
- Hermit wizards in towers take promising youths

**Cultural View**:
- Just as respected as academy education
- More personalized, but less prestigious network

---

### Self-Taught (Rare)

**Who does this**:
- Sorcerers (innate power, no teacher needed)
- Desperate individuals who find spellbooks
- Hermits or outcasts

**Risks**:
- No oversight (easy to make catastrophic mistakes)
- Socially isolated (no network or mentorship)
- Viewed as dangerous by established mages

---

### Military Training (Specialized)

**Where it happens**:
- National armies train war mages
- [[Northern Power (Macedonian Bloc)]] has battle-mage academies

**Focus**:
- Combat magic only (Fireball, Shield, Counterspell)
- Tactics and unit coordination
- No theoretical or philosophical training

**Cultural View**:
- Respected for utility, not intellectualism
- "Wands for hire"

---

## Academy Politics & Factions

### How Academies View the Relic Race

**Hogwarts**: Neutral but concerned (graduates serve various factions)
**Beauxbatons**: Interested in relic aesthetics and enchantment properties
**Durmstrang**: Pragmatic—relics are weapons, treat them as such
**Athenian Academy**: Relics belong in Greek institutions (aligned with [[Northern Power (Macedonian Bloc)]])
**Thessaloniki Collegiate**: Wants to study relics but lacks resources

### Can the Party Recruit From Academies?

**Yes, but it's complicated**:
- Academy graduates are in high demand (nobles hire them immediately)
- Party could hire a **recent graduate** (young, inexperienced, cheaper)
- Or commission services (pay a professor for research/translation)

**Potential NPC Ally**:
- A Thessaloniki graduate who idolizes the party (wants to join their adventures)
- Stats: **Mage** (MM p. 347) or **Conjurer/Evoker** (VGM)

---

## Academy Resources for Players

### What the Party Can Access

**If they visit an academy**:
1. **Library** (historical research on relics)
   - Requires: Permission (letter of introduction, faction backing, or reputation)
   - Benefit: Learn relic lore, identify artifacts, translate ancient texts

2. **Faculty Expertise** (consultations)
   - Requires: Payment (50-500 gp depending on complexity)
   - Benefit: Identify magic items, analyze relic effects, commission enchantments

3. **Spell Scrolls & Components** (shop)
   - Requires: Gold
   - Benefit: Buy uncommon scrolls, rare components

4. **Sanctuary** (safe haven)
   - Requires: Good reputation with that academy
   - Benefit: Rest without fear of faction attacks (academies are neutral ground)

### What the Party Cannot Access

- **Forbidden knowledge** without permission (Durmstrang's dark arts section, etc.)
- **Teleportation circles** (too valuable, restricted to faculty)
- **Artifact vaults** (academies store dangerous relics—heavily warded)

---

## Campaign Hooks Involving Academies

### 1. "The Scholar's Plea"
A Thessaloniki professor hires the party to retrieve a relic before a rival faction does. She promises academic support in return.

### 2. "The Durmstrang Mercenary"
A Durmstrang graduate is hired by [[Cult of Vasilis (Remnants)]] to hunt the party. Encounter = combat + moral question (does he question his orders?).

### 3. "The Athenian Rivalry"
Athenian Academy sends representatives to Thessaloniki, demanding the party surrender relics "for proper study." They're condescending. Party must navigate politics.

### 4. "The Hogwarts Alumni Network"
A British diplomat (Hogwarts graduate) offers the party a deal: information on a relic in exchange for escorting supplies to a dangerous region.

### 5. "The Forbidden Tome"
The party learns of a book in Durmstrang's library that contains relic resurrection rituals (like the one Vasilis attempted). Do they steal it, buy it, or let it be?

## Magic Schools in Other Regions (Framework)

When the party travels, use this template:

### [Country] Academy of [Magic Type]
**Location**: [City]
**Reputation**: [What they're known for]
**Specialization**: [1-2 magical focuses]
**Political Alignment**: [Neutral, aligned with a faction, independent]
**What They Offer the Party**: [Library, faculty, sanctuary, etc.]

**Example (if party goes to Egypt)**:
### Alexandrian Institute of the Arcane
**Location**: Alexandria, Egypt
**Reputation**: Ancient traditions, necromancy, divine magic
**Specialization**: Death magic (regulated), oracle training
**Political Alignment**: Independent but courted by all factions
**What They Offer the Party**: Unparalleled historical records, access to Egyptian relics

---

## DM Notes: Balancing Academy Presence

### Don't Overuse Them
- Academies should feel **special** when encountered
- They're not quest hubs—they're resources
- Too much access = magic feels less rare

### Make Them Politically Neutral (Mostly)
- Academies don't take sides in the Relic Race (officially)
- Individual faculty might have opinions, but institutions stay neutral
- This makes them safe havens and neutral meeting grounds

### Use Alumni as NPCs
- Instead of visiting the academy itself, introduce graduates
- Ally: A Beauxbatons enchanter hires the party
- Rival: A Durmstrang mercenary hunts them
- Contact: A Hogwarts diplomat offers information

## Harry Potter Influence: What to Keep vs. Adapt

### Keep (Works in This World)
✅ Three famous European schools (Hogwarts, Beauxbatons, Durmstrang)
✅ School rivalry and alumni pride
✅ Academies as prestigious, selective institutions
✅ Mixture of magical traditions

### Adapt (Changed for D&D Campaign)
🔄 **No houses** (too specific to Hogwarts, not needed)
🔄 **No Quidditch** (but you could have magical dueling tournaments)
🔄 **No Voldemort narrative** (this is a political campaign, not a dark lord story)
🔄 **Academies are not hidden** (magic isn't secret from non-mages)

### Skip (Doesn't Fit)
❌ Ministry of Magic (governments and academies are separate)
❌ Wands as unique soul-bound items (D&D uses arcane focuses more generically)
❌ Platform 9¾ / magical concealment (magic is accepted, not hidden)
