# How Magic Works

A comprehensive guide to magic in *The Relic Race* campaign setting.

---

## Core Principle: Magic is Rare But Accepted

Think of magic like **PhDs in the real world**:
- Everyone knows they exist
- People respect those who have them
- Most people don't have one and never will
- It's not supernatural to *have* one, but it is exceptional

**In practical terms**:
- **90-95% of people can't cast a cantrip**
- **Every city has priests** (divine magic)
- **Oracles are respected** (divination is valuable)
- **Noble courts employ a mage** (the *one* mage they can afford)
- **Sailors believe in sea curses** (folklore rooted in truth)

**The party being magical doesn't break the world. It makes them exceptional.**

## Why Relics Matter

### In a World Where Magic is Rare:

**Relics become**:
1. **Symbols of Legitimacy** - "I have Alexander's Crown; I am his successor"
2. **Military Advantages** - A relic can equal 1,000 soldiers
3. **Divine Curiosities** - Proof of mythological truth
4. **Political Leverage** - Nations will pay fortunes or go to war for them

### The Belief Engine
If **one relic** like [[The Crown of Kings]] exists, people assume **more exist**.

That belief alone is enough to ignite competition.

**The Relic Race doesn't require you to predefine every artifact. Let rumors drive it.**

## Who Can Use Magic?

### Divine Magic (Most Common)
**Source**: Gods grant power to faithful mortals

**Who Has It**:
- **Priests** (in temples across every city)
- **Oracles** (rare, respected, often live in isolation)
- **Paladins** (knights sworn to divine oaths)
- **Clerics** (adventuring or battlefield priests)

**Accessibility**: 
- Anyone can *pray*, but only the faithful are *answered*
- Temples teach ritual, not spellcasting
- Most priests can perform blessings (non-magical) but not miracles (magical)

**Cultural View**: 
Divine magic is **trusted**. It's expected. "The gods provide."

---

### Arcane Magic (Rare & Studied)
**Source**: Understanding fundamental forces of reality—patterns, formulae, cosmic laws

**Who Has It**:
- **Wizards** (years of study at academies or under mentors)
- **Sorcerers** (born with innate power—bloodline or cosmic accident)
- **Artificers** (blend magic with craftsmanship)
- **Bards** (weave magic through art and performance)

**Accessibility**:
- Requires **education or innate talent**
- Wizards train at academies (see [[Magical Academies]])
- Sorcerers are born, not made (viewed as touched by fate)
- Artificers apprentice under masters like [[Master Ornn]]

**Cultural View**:
Arcane magic is **respected but wary**. It's power without divine oversight.

Common folk think:
- *"Wizards are wise but arrogant"*
- *"Sorcerers are dangerous—they didn't earn their power"*
- *"Artificers make useful things, so they're tolerable"*

---

### Nature Magic (Uncommon, Regional)
**Source**: The natural world—forests, seas, storms

**Who Has It**:
- **Druids** (guardians of wild places)
- **Rangers** (survivalists with minor magic)

**Accessibility**:
- You don't *study* nature magic; you're *chosen* by it
- Druids live in groves, not cities (rarely seen by common folk)
- Rangers are self-taught or mentor-taught

**Cultural View**:
Nature magic is **mysterious and distant**. 

People believe in dryads, nymphs, and forest spirits, but rarely encounter them.

---

### Pact Magic (Very Rare, Stigmatized)
**Source**: Bargains with otherworldly entities—fiends, fey, eldritch beings

**Who Has It**:
- **Warlocks** (those who made a pact)

**Accessibility**:
- No training required—just a deal
- Dangerous (you owe someone powerful)

**Cultural View**:
Pact magic is **feared**. 

People whisper: *"Did they sell their soul?"*

Warlocks hide their power or lie about its source.

## Magic in Daily Life

### What Common People Experience

**They See**:
- Priests healing minor injuries at temples
- Mages lighting streetlamps with *Continual Flame* (in wealthy cities)
- Oracles making vague predictions (which nobles take seriously)
- Enchanted items in noble courts (often family heirlooms)

**They Don't See**:
- Fireballs exploding in streets
- Daily magical conveniences (no magic refrigerators)
- Teleportation or resurrection (those are *legends*)

**What They Believe**:
- Curses are real (sailors refuse to anger sea gods)
- Ghosts exist (ancient ruins are haunted)
- Magic items are ancient (modern mages can't replicate them)

---

## Magic Items & Enchantment

### Availability by Tier

| Rarity | Examples | Acquisition |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| **Common** | *Healing potion*, *torch that never goes out* | Bought in large cities (expensive but available) |
| **Uncommon** | *+1 weapon*, *cloak of protection* | Commission from master artisans or loot ancient sites |
| **Rare** | *Bag of holding*, *+2 weapon*, *ring of spell storing* | Reward from nobles, found in dangerous ruins |
| **Very Rare** | *+3 weapon*, *amulet of the planes* | Legendary treasures, one-of-a-kind items |
| **Legendary** | [[The Crown of Kings]], artifacts of gods | **Relics** that nations go to war over |

### Can Magic Items Be Made?

**Yes, but it's difficult**:
- Requires high-level casters or master artificers
- Takes months/years of work
- Drains resources (gold, rare materials, time)

**Most magic items are ancient**:
- Created in previous eras (when magic was more common or gods walked the earth)
- Found in ruins, tombs, or battlefields
- Families pass them down as heirlooms

**This is why relics are so valuable**: Modern smiths can't replicate them.

## The Gods & Faith

### The Olympian Pantheon (Dominant in Greece)

**The Twelve Olympians**:
Zeus, Hera, Poseidon, Demeter, Athena, Apollo, Artemis, Ares, Hephaestus, Aphrodite, Hermes, Dionysus

**Lesser Gods & Demigods**:
Hades, Persephone, Hestia, Pan, Hecate, and countless nymphs, spirits, and minor deities

**How They're Worshiped**:
- Temples in every city (priests perform rituals)
- Oracles deliver prophecies (Delphi is famous)
- Festivals and sacrifices (public, celebratory)
- Personal shrines in homes (daily prayers)

**Do the Gods Intervene?**:
- **Yes, but rarely directly**
- They answer prayers (healing, blessings)
- They send omens (storms, dreams, visions)
- They grant power to chosen mortals (clerics, paladins)
- **They don't appear in mortal form** (that's mythology, not current reality)

### Christianity (Minority Cult, Growing)

**Status**: A smaller, newer faith

**Beliefs**: 
- One God (radical in a polytheistic world)
- Salvation, resurrection, eternal life

**Cultural Position**:
- Viewed as eccentric but harmless
- Temples exist (like [[Church of St. Dimitrios]])
- Some nobles convert (political or personal reasons)
- Tensions with Olympian traditionalists (but not violent—yet)

**Why It Exists Here**:
- Explains why the Church of St. Dimitrios is real in Thessaloniki
- Adds religious diversity and potential conflict
- Mirrors historical religious coexistence/tension

**Do Christian Priests Have Magic?**:
Yes—clerics and paladins of the Christian God are just as real as Olympian ones.

## Schools of Magic (Where Wizards Learn)

See full details in [[Magical Academies]].

### The Famous Three (Europe)

1. **Hogwarts** (Britain) - Known for rigorous tradition
2. **Beauxbatons** (France) - Known for elegance and refinement
3. **Durmstrang** (Northern Europe) - Known for martial magic and darker studies

These are the "Ivy League" of magic—everyone's heard of them.

### Regional Academies
Most countries have **one** major academy (not all are famous):
- **Thessaloniki's Academy** (Greece) - Small but respectable, tied to Olympian temples
- **Others as needed** - We'll design them if the party travels there

## Magic & Power Dynamics

### Why the Party Matters

**Because they can cast spells**, the party is:
- **Valuable** (factions want to hire them)
- **Dangerous** (factions want to control or eliminate them)
- **Exceptional** (common people view them with awe or fear)

### How Factions Use Magic

**[[Northern Power (Macedonian Bloc)]]**:
- Battle mages in military units (rare, elite)
- Court wizards for strategic advice
- Seeking relics to *supplement* their military (not replace it)

**[[Maritime City-State]]**:
- Weather mages for naval advantage
- Diviners to predict trade routes
- Relics to protect fleets from supernatural threats

**[[Cult of Vasilis (Remnants)]]**:
- Scholars who study ancient magic (not many casters among them)
- Use relics *ritually* (like attempting to resurrect Darius)
- View magic as a tool to "correct history"

**[[Scholarly Order]]**:
- Largest concentration of wizards outside academies
- Study magic academically
- Contain dangerous artifacts in warded vaults

## Rules for DM (Consistency Notes)

### Magic Item Pricing
Use DMG guidelines, but:
- **Common items**: 50-100 gp
- **Uncommon items**: 500-5,000 gp
- **Rare items**: 5,000-50,000 gp
- **Relics**: Priceless (nations trade land, armies, or alliances for them)

### NPC Spellcasters
- **Most priests**: Level 1-3 (can cast *Cure Wounds*, *Bless*)
- **Court mages**: Level 3-5 (utility spells, rarely combat)
- **Faction leaders**: Level 5-10 (powerful but not invincible)
- **Legendary figures** (like Ornn): Level 15+ (but not antagonistic)

### Magic in Combat
- **Enemies shouldn't spam fireballs** (magic is rare—even villains use it strategically)
- **Environmental magic** (traps, wards, ancient defenses) is fair game
- **Counterspell** is rare (only high-level mages or academies have it)

---

## Player Character Implications

### Your Party is Exceptional
- Most adventurers are **not** spellcasters (they're skilled fighters, scouts, thieves)
- The party having 2-3 casters is **remarkable**
- NPCs will comment on this ("Three wizards in one party? That's a small army!")

### Magic Draws Attention
- Using flashy spells in public → Guards investigate, factions hear about it
- Spellcasting in combat → Enemies prioritize casters (they're threats)
- Having magic items → Thieves, collectors, or factions may try to acquire them

### Reputation Matters
- "The party who stopped Vasilis" → Known to have power
- Factions *want* the party on their side
- This gives leverage in negotiations
