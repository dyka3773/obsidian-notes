## Thessaloniki's Role in the Relic Race

### Why Factions Care About Thessaloniki

1. **It's where the Crown was found** (the city has historical significance)
2. **Strategic port** (controls access to northern Aegean)
3. **Neutral ground** (no single faction controls it—yet)
4. **Information hub** (sailors bring rumors from across the Mediterranean)

### Faction Presence in the City

**[[Northern Power (Macedonian Bloc)]]**:
- Embassy in the Wealthy Estates
- Recruiters in the Agora
- Goal: Pressure Thessaloniki to ally with them

**[[Maritime City-State]]**:
- Merchant ships in the Harbor
- Spies in the docks and warehouses
- Goal: Control trade routes through the harbor

**[[Cult of Vasilis (Remnants)]]**:
- Hidden cells in the Slums
- Infiltrators in the Temple Quarter
- Goal: Recover the Crown or take revenge on the party

**[[Scholarly Order]]**:
- Contacts in the Collegiate
- Scholars researching in the Temple libraries
- Goal: Document relic discoveries, prevent misuse

## Thessaloniki as a Safe Haven

### Services Available

**Healing**: Temple of Athena, Church of St. Dimitrios
**Shopping**: Agora (common items), Artisan Quarter (magic items up to uncommon)
**Information**: Dimitris, sailors, scholars
**Sanctuary**: The Collegiate (if the party has good standing)
**Resurrection** (if needed): High Priestess of Athena (expensive, requires favor)

### When It's Not Safe

**The city becomes dangerous if**:
- The party makes enemies of the City Guard
- Factions openly hunt the party
- Cult assassins strike in public

If Thessaloniki becomes hostile, the party can flee to:
- [[Skouries & Chalkidiki]] (dwarf's destination)
- Aegean islands (pirate havens)
- Other city-states (Athens, Corinth, Delphi)

## DM Notes: Running Thessaloniki

### Atmosphere Tips

### Random Thessaloniki Encounters (d6)

2. **Noble's carriage** nearly runs over the party (accident or intimidation?)
3. **Thieves** attempt to pickpocket the party
4. **Faction spy** follows the party (Insight check to notice)
