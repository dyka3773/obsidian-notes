## Thessaloniki's Role in [[the Relic Race]]

### Why Factions Care About Thessaloniki
1. **It's where the Crown was found** (the city has historical significance)
2. **Strategic port** (controls access to northern Aegean)
3. **Neutral ground** (no single faction controls it yet)
4. **Information hub** (sailors bring rumors from across the Mediterranean)
## Adventure Hooks in Thessaloniki

### 1. "[[DnD/Campaigns/The Relic Race/NPCs/Dimitris|Dimitris]]'s Next Job"
[[DnD/Campaigns/Your First One-Shot/NPCs/Dimitris|Dimitris]] hires the party again (this time, to investigate Cult safe houses or retrieve smuggled goods).
### 2. "The Archon's Dilemma"
The Archon summons the party: two factions are pressuring the city to take sides. The party must navigate political intrigue.
### 3. "Cult Revenge"
Surviving cultists attempt to assassinate the party in the Slums. Fight or investigate?
### 4. "The Oracle's Prophecy"
The party pays for a prophecy. It's cryptic but hints at the next relic location.
### 5. "The Professor's Request"
A professor hires the party to escort them to a ruin (research trip turns into an encounter).

## Thessaloniki as a Safe Haven

### Services Available
**Healing**: Temple of Athena, Church of St. Dimitrios
**Shopping**: Agora (common items), Artisan Quarter (magic items up to uncommon)
**Information**: [[DnD/Campaigns/The Relic Race/NPCs/Dimitris|Dimitris]], sailors, scholars
**Sanctuary**: The Collegiate (if the party has good standing)
**[[Resurrection]]** (if needed): High Priestess of Athena (expensive, requires favor)
### When It's Not Safe
**The city becomes dangerous if**:
- The party makes enemies of the City Guard
- Factions openly hunt the party
- Cult assassins strike in public
If Thessaloniki becomes hostile, the party can flee to:
- [[Skouries & Chalkidiki]] (dwarf's destination)
- Aegean islands (pirate havens)
- Other city-states (Athens, Corinth, Delphi)

## DM Notes: Running Thessaloniki

### Atmosphere Tips
- **Bustling and alive** (always something happening)
- **Politically tense** (factions operate openly but carefully)

### Random Thessaloniki Encounters (d6)
1. **Street preacher** warns that "the relics will doom us all"
2. **Noble's carriage** nearly runs over the party (accident or intimidation?)
3. **Thieves** attempt to pickpocket the party
4. **Faction spy** follows the party (Insight check to notice)
5. **Merchant** offers to buy any relics the party has (suspiciously high price)
6. **City guard** questions the party about recent crimes
