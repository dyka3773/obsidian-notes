# Elderyn Mossvale

An elderly halfling innkeeper who hires the adventurers for their quest.

## Basic Info
- **Race/Type**: Halfling
- **Age**: 67
- **Role**: Innkeeper and Quest Giver
- **Allegiance**: Friendly to party
- **Status**: Alive

## Appearance
Elderyn is a portly halfling with silver-gray hair tied back in a neat bun. She wears practical clothing - an apron over a simple brown dress - and always has flour on her hands from baking. Her warm brown eyes crinkle when she smiles, which is often, but lately worry lines have appeared on her face.

## Personality & Mannerisms
- **Quirks**: 
  - Speaks in a grandmotherly way, calls everyone "dear"
  - Always offers food and tea before business talk
  - Wrings her hands when nervous
- **Speech Pattern**: Warm, concerned, speaks quickly when worried
  - "Oh dear, oh dear, this is most troubling!"
  - "You look hungry, dear. Let me fetch you something."
- **Motivations**: 
  - Protect her inn and the travelers on the road
  - Keep the community safe
- **Fears/Secrets**: 
  - Afraid the goblin attacks will ruin her business
  - Her son was injured by goblins last year

## Background
Elderyn has run the Mossy Oak Inn for 30 years, inheriting it from her parents. She's well-known in the region as a kind hostess who makes the best apple pie. Recently, goblin attacks on the forest road have scared away guests, threatening her livelihood.

Her adult son, Merrick, was wounded by goblins on the same road a year ago and now walks with a limp. This makes her especially worried about travelers.

## Relationship with Party
- **First Met**: [At the inn, when party arrives in town]
- **Current Attitude**: Hopeful and grateful
- **Quest Hook**: 
  - Hires party to investigate goblin attacks on forest road
  - Offers: 50 gp + free room and board for a week
  - Information: Attacks started 2 weeks ago, several merchants robbed
