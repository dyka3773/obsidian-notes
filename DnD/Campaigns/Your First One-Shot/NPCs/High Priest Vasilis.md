# High Priest Vasilis

A charismatic religious leader secretly working to resurrect Darius III. He's beloved, respected, and absolutely dangerous.

## Basic Info
- **Race/Type**: Human
- **Age**: 52
- **Role**: High Priest of the Temple of Asclepius (publicly); Cult Leader (secretly)
- **Allegiance**: Evil/Self-serving
- **Status**: Alive (until confrontation)

## Appearance
Vasilis is a striking figure, tall and lean with silver-streaked dark hair that he keeps immaculate. He wears fine robes of crimson and gold, the colors of the Temple of Asclepius. A golden amulet hangs from his neck (contains a fragment of [[the Crown of Kings]], for scrying). His eyes are calm and kind on the surface, but there's something unsettling in their depths, a hunger that doesn't quite match his warm smile.

## Personality & Mannerisms
- **Quirks**:
  - Speaks in measured, thoughtful tones
  - Often quotes historical figures and philosophy
  - Has a habit of touching his amulet when thinking
  - Laughs genuinely but it never quite reaches his eyes
- **Speech Pattern**: 
  - Eloquent and persuasive
  - "The safety of the city depends on this relic. You understand, don't you?"
  - "History is a teacher, if we're wise enough to listen."
- **Motivations**:
  - Believes Darius III was wronged by history
  - Wants to resurrect him to "correct" Alexander's conquests
  - Power and dominion over others
- **Secrets**:
  - Leads a hidden cult of 20+ followers
  - Has been planning this for 15+ years
  - Willing to sacrifice innocents to achieve goals

## Backstory
Vasilis was not always a villain. As a young scholar, he became obsessed with the life of Darius III, convinced that history had been written by Alexander's victors. He researched for decades, eventually discovering [[the Crown of Kings]] was real and hidden in the catacombs beneath Thessaloniki.

Over time, his academic fascination turned into an obsession, then a conviction: Darius III was the rightful ruler, and Alexander was a tyrant. Moving to Thessaloniki, he gradually gained influence in the Temple of Asclepius, eventually becoming High Priest. All the while, he built a secret cult devoted to his cause.

Now, with the relic within reach, he's ready to resurrect his "rightful lord."

## Relationship with Party
- **First Met**: In the temple, when he "hires" them
- **Current Attitude**: Patronizing, grandly polite, condescending
- **The Job**: "Retrieve [[the Crown of Kings]] from a dangerous warlord who keeps it locked away. Bring it to me, and you'll be rewarded handsomely."
- **True Motive**: Use them to bypass the guardian, steal the relic, resurrect Darius III

## For the Confrontation
- **In the catacombs**, he arrives with 4 cultist guards (use commoner/bandit stat blocks)
- **His goal**: Activate the Crown in the relic chamber
- **His weakness**: Relies on magic; if you strip spell components, he's vulnerable
- **His advantage**: His cult followers and knowledge of the catacombs

## DM Notes
- Vasilis believes he's the hero of his own story. He genuinely thinks he's correcting a historical wrong
- This makes him more dangerous than a typical villain
- He's NOT evil for evil's sake; he's a true believer
- The party might sympathize with his goal if they hear his reasoning (don't let them!)
- If captured, he'll try to convince them to join his cause or reveal information about the cult
- His defeat doesn't solve everything, the cult still exists unless dealt with
