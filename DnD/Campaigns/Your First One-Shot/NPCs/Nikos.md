# Nikos of the Catacombs

A grim warrior sworn to protect [[the Crown of Kings]]. He's hostile and powerful, but his cause is just. A descendant of Alexander's generals, bound by oath to keep the relic safe.

## Basic Info
- **Race/Type**: Human (with magical longevity)
- **Age**: Appears to be in his 40s, but is much older (see background)
- **Role**: Guardian of [[the Crown of Kings]]
- **Allegiance**: Neutral Good (fiercely protective)
- **Status**: Alive (boss encounter)

## Appearance
Nikos is scarred and weathered, a man who has lived through terrible things. He wears ancient armor of excellent make, covered in dust and signs of age. His dark hair is streaked with gray, and a long scar runs from his left temple to his jaw. His eyes are gray and intense, missing nothing. Despite his age, he moves with the grace of a trained warrior.

Around his wrist is an ancient bronze bracelet inscribed with Greek text, a magical charm that grants him extended life to guard the relic.

## Personality & Mannerisms
- **Quirks**:
  - Speaks rarely, only when necessary
  - Has a haunted look in his eyes
  - Maintains near-silent vigil over the relic chamber
  - Shows respect to those who fight with honor
- **Speech Pattern**: 
  - Direct and blunt
  - "You should not be here."
  - "The Crown will not leave this place while I draw breath."
  - If the party shows genuine honor: "Perhaps... there is hope yet."
- **Motivations**:
  - Fulfill the oath he swore generations ago
  - Prevent the resurrection of Darius III (he knows what happened if it occurred)
  - Protect innocents from the relic's power
- **Fears**:
  - That his sacrifice will be meaningless
  - That someone will succeed in stealing the relic
  - The High Priest (he doesn't know [[High Priest Vasilis|Vasilis]] specifically, but senses danger)

## Backstory
Nikos is a descendant of one of Alexander the Great's most trusted generals. When Alexander died, his general took [[the Crown of Kings]] and hid it, knowing its power was too great for any one person. The general swore an oath: *"I and my line will guard this relic until the world is ready for its truth."*

That oath has passed through centuries. When Nikos was born about 150 years ago, the magical bracelet was activated, granting him extended life. He has lived in the catacombs since, watching over the Crown, waiting for someone worthy or a sign that the oath could be broken.

He's watched as High Priests came and went. But something changed recently, he felt a darkness approaching, a hunger for the relic. He doesn't know [[High Priest Vasilis|Vasilis]] by name, but he knows someone is coming for it.

## Relationship with Party
- **First Met**: In the guardian's chamber, during infiltration
- **Current Attitude**: Hostile and defensive (they're intruders trying to steal the relic)
- **Combat**: Can fight them, but will pause if they show they mean no harm
- **Dialogue**: "Why do you take the relic? Who sent you?"
- **Discovery**: If the party reveals they were hired by the High Priest, his attitude hardens
- **Possible Ally**: If convinced of the High Priest's evil, he can become a powerful ally

## Tactics in Combat
- **Opening**: Tries to drive party away from the relic chamber
- **Mid-combat**: If outnumbered or the party shows honor, he pauses to talk
- **Goal**: Stop them from taking the relic, not necessarily kill them
- **Weakness**: Doesn't want to fight good people; will negotiate if convinced

## If Party Defeats Him
- He won't die, he admits defeat with honor
- "You have proven yourselves worthy. But know this: the relic is a burden, not a prize. Use it wisely."
- He reveals the truth about the High Priest (if the party hasn't figured it out)
- He can guide them to stop [[High Priest Vasilis|Vasilis]]

## If Party Allies with Him
- He becomes a powerful ally in the final confrontation
- Provides knowledge of the catacombs
- Can help plan strategy against [[High Priest Vasilis|Vasilis]] and his cultists
- Offers guidance on the relic's true nature

## DM Notes
- Nikos is not an obstacle to overcome; he's a test of the party's intentions
- Combat should feel weighty and serious, not like a typical boss fight
- Allow for negotiation and roleplay
- If the party truly impresses him, he'll sacrifice himself to help them later
- His dialogue should convey weariness and isolation, he's tired of his vigil
