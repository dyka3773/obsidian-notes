- **Role**: Foot soldiers and enforcers for the cult, tasked with protecting the High Priest and the relics.
- **Allegiance**: Depending on the encounter, they may be loyal to the High Priest or simply mercenaries hired for protection.
- **Status**: alive

## Appearance

Cultist Guards typically wear dark, hooded robes adorned with the cult's insignia. They carry simple weapons like daggers or short swords, and their faces are often obscured by masks or hoods to maintain anonymity. They may have tattoos or markings that signify their rank or devotion to the cult.

## Personality & Mannerisms

- **Speech Pattern**: They speak in a formal, reverent tone when addressing the High Priest or discussing the cult's beliefs. When interacting with outsiders, they may be more curt and threatening.
- **Motivations**: Their primary motivation is to serve the cult and its leader, whether out of genuine belief, fear, or a desire for power. They may also be motivated by the promise of rewards or advancement within the cult.
- **Fears/Secrets**: They may fear punishment from the High Priest for failure or disloyalty. Some may harbor doubts about the cult's goals or methods but are too afraid to express them.

## Background

Cultist Guards are recruited from various backgrounds, often drawn to the cult by promises of power, wealth, or a sense of belonging. They may have been former soldiers, mercenaries, or individuals seeking purpose. Their training is rigorous, focusing on combat skills and loyalty to the cult. They are often stationed in key locations, such as the catacombs or the High Priest's chambers, to protect the cult's interests and enforce its will.

## Relationship with Party
- **First Met**: [[Encounter - Infiltrating the Catacombs]] (if they take the combat or stealth path)
- **Current Attitude**: Hostile (if combat), Suspicious (if stealth), Neutral (if social)
