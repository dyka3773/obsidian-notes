# Dimitris the Informant

A street-smart information broker who finds the party and leads them to the High Priest. He doesn't know the full truth, he's just trying to make coin and stay alive.

## Basic Info
- **Race/Type**: Human
- **Age**: 35
- **Role**: Information Broker / Merchant / Spy
- **Allegiance**: Neutral (self-serving)
- **Status**: Alive (quest-giver)

## Appearance
Dimitris is average-looking in a way that makes him forgettable, brown hair, brown eyes, nondescript clothing. This is intentional; he's built his career on not being noticed. He wears practical merchant's clothes and always carries a satchel full of "wares" (usually stolen goods or information). He fidgets constantly, tapping fingers, shifting weight, glancing around.

## Personality & Mannerisms
- **Quirks**:
  - Talks fast when nervous
  - Uses hand gestures excessively
  - Always has a deal or favor to propose
  - Defensive but not hostile
- **Speech Pattern**:
  - Casual tavern speech, lots of slang
  - "Listen, I got a proposition for you..."
  - "No questions, you understand? Just do the job."
  - Often repeats himself when anxious
- **Motivations**:
  - Easy money (the High Priest pays well)
  - Staying alive and out of trouble
  - Building connections and favors
- **Fears**:
  - Getting caught in the middle of something dangerous
  - The High Priest (who employs him indirectly)
  - Failing assignments and losing pay

## Backstory
Dimitris grew up on Thessaloniki's streets and learned early: information is currency. He built a network of contacts, merchants, guards, beggars, who feed him gossip and secrets. He sells what he hears to anyone willing to pay.

A few months ago, a mysterious man (one of [[High Priest Vasilis|Vasilis]]'s cultists) approached him with a lucrative offer: find capable adventurers and convince them to steal an artifact from the catacombs. Dimitris didn't ask questions, he was too well-paid. He assumed it was a simple heist job.

He still doesn't know about [[High Priest Vasilis|Vasilis]], the relic's true power, or Darius III.

## Relationship with Party
- **First Met**: In a tavern, approaching them with the "job offer"
- **Current Attitude**: Professional, friendly, but self-serving
- **The Pitch**: "I got a job for capable folks like you. Good pay, simple work. Steal artifact from a warlord, bring it to a very important man. Easy."
- **Payment**: 25 gp upfront, 75 gp on completion
- **Exit Strategy**: He plans to disappear once they complete the job

## Game Stats (NPC, not a combatant)
**AC**: 12 | **HP**: 4 | **Speed**: 30 ft.

He's not built for combat and will flee if violence starts. Perfectly ordinary human commoner/merchant.

## For the Table
- **Information Source**: He can answer basic questions about the High Priest (publicly known info only)
- **Guidance**: He'll lead the party to the temple district to meet [[High Priest Vasilis|Vasilis]]
- **Red Herring**: Players might suspect he's the villain; he's not (he's just caught up in it)
- **Development**: After they learn the truth, the party might want to question him about his employer

## If Party Interrogates Him Later
- He genuinely doesn't know much: "I was hired by some guy in a hood! I never asked questions!"
- He can describe his contact (one of [[High Priest Vasilis|Vasilis]]'s cultists)
- He's terrified of both the party and the High Priest
- He'll provide any information to stay alive
- Possible redemption: Help them track down other cultists in exchange for protection

## DM Notes
- Dimitris is comic relief and plot device, use him to set the adventure in motion
- Don't make him annoying; he's nervous and practical
- If the party likes him, he could become a recurring contact
- He's useful for delivering messages/information later
- His fear of the High Priest makes him easy to manipulate once the truth is revealed


## Make the offer Irresistible

### For Greedy Characters:
Dimitri offers 50 gp upfront, 100 gp on completion (that's a LOT for level 1!)
"You could buy weapons, armor, a horse, lodging for weeks..."

### For Heroic Characters:
Dimitri adds: "The High Priest helps the poor and sick. He needs this to keep the city safe."
"Without the relic secured, dangerous forces might claim it."

### For Curious/Lore Characters:
"An ancient artifact from Alexander the Great's era! Think of the history!"
"You might be the first to see something lost for 2000 years."

### For Cautious Characters:
"The High Priest is well-respected. You can meet him before accepting."
"You're not alone—he'll provide maps, information, supplies."
