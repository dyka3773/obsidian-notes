# Example Location: Forest Road

A common dirt road through a dense forest, often used by merchants and travelers.

## Quick Overview
A narrow dirt road winds through thick forest, making it a perfect spot for ambushes.

## General Description
This stretch of road passes through a dense woodland area. Ancient oak and pine trees crowd both sides, their branches creating a canopy overhead that filters sunlight into dappled patterns on the ground. The underbrush is thick with ferns and brambles, making it difficult to see more than 30 feet into the forest.

The road itself is well-worn but not well-maintained - muddy ruts from wagon wheels mark the passage of merchants. Birds call from the canopy, and the forest smells of pine needles and damp earth.
