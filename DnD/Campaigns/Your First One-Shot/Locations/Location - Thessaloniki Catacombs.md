# Location: Thessaloniki Catacombs

An ancient underground labyrinth beneath Thessaloniki, dating back to Alexander's era. It serves as the hidden resting place of [[the Crown of Kings]] and the domain of its eternal guardian, Nikias.

## Quick Overview
Beneath the bustling streets of Thessaloniki lies a vast maze of catacombs & burial chambers, mysterious tunnels, and forgotten shrines. The air is cold and damp. Ancient statues line the walls, some animate with magical protection. In its deepest chamber lies [[the Crown of Kings]], hidden from the world for over two thousand years.

## General Description
The catacombs smell of earth and age. Water drips from carved stone ceilings, creating echoes that make any sound feel amplified. Faint phosphorescent moss glows on portions of the walls, providing dim light. The air is thin and cool.

The walls are carved with ancient Greek inscriptions and intricate reliefs depicting Alexander's conquests, military campaigns, and mystical imagery. Many walls show signs of deliberate craftsmanship. Τhese catacombs were built with purpose, not accident.

As you venture deeper, the air grows colder. Magical auras shimmer faintly around certain areas. The deeper you go, the more you sense something _old_ and _aware_ watching you.

## Geography & Layout

### The Upper Catacombs (Entry Level)
**Atmosphere**: Burial chambers, can still smell the outside world
**Features**:
- Main entrance: Hidden beneath a 500-year-old monastery (now a ruin)
- Multiple burial alcoves carved into walls
- Stone sarcophagi with faded names
- Several side passages (some lead nowhere, some loop back)
- Ancient frescoes depicting funeral rites

**Access**: [[Dimitris]] should provide directions to the hidden entrance. The monastery is known to locals as dangerous (correct, there are traps).

### Mid-Level: The Guardian's Passages
**Atmosphere**: Becomes more mystical, temperature drops, magical auras visible
**Features**:
- Wider passages with high ceilings
- Statuary lining the walls (some animate)
- Pools of clear water (cold, deep, mysterious)
- Carved archways with inscriptions
- Signs of habitation: a bedroll, simple supplies, a fire pit

**Encounters**:
- Patrolling [[Cultist Guard|cultist guards]] (if [[High Priest Vasilis|Vasilis]] sent reinforcements)
- The animated stone guardians (lions, horse statues, etc.)
- Environmental hazards (unstable floors, hidden water channels)

### The Relic Chamber (Deepest Level)
**Atmosphere**: Sacred, ominous, otherworldly
**Features**:
- Circular chamber with high vaulted ceiling
- [[The Crown of Kings]] displayed on a stone pedestal in the center
- [[Nikos]]'s vigil station (a chair, a small shrine, books)
- Murals depicting Darius III's defeat and burial curses
- Magical glyphs arranged in protective circles around the relic

**Danger**: The air itself feels heavy with magic. Moving toward the relic triggers mystical alarms.

## Key Features

### The Stone Guardians
Multiple animated statues protect the catacombs:
- **Stone Lions** (2-4): Carved replicas of Alexander's companions, animated by ancient magic
- **Peritas the Hound** (spectral): Alexander's legendary dog, manifested as a ghostly guardian
- **The Drakofido** (in the deepest chamber): A massive serpentine dragon sculpture that animates to defend the relic chamber

### The Inscriptions
Throughout the catacombs are ancient Greek inscriptions. Some say:
- "Here lies the burden of the world's mightiest king"
- "Let no hand take what conquers all hands"

### The Water
Underground streams run through the catacombs. Some areas have:
- Deep underground pools (DC 13 Swim to cross)
- Flowing channels that could be dangerous
- Fresh spring water (safe to drink)

- **Total descent time**: ~30-45 minutes of session time (includes encounters)

## Secrets & Hidden Elements

### Secret Passages
- A small hidden chamber contains old journals written by previous guardians (lore, clues about the relic)
- A passage leads to an underground river (could be escape route if needed)

### The Burial of Darius III
One section of the catacombs contains murals depicting Darius III's supposed burial. The party might realize the High Priest could be trying to reverse a curse or ritual.

### The Oath
Inscribed in the deepest chamber is the ancient oath taken by Alexander's general: "I and my line shall guard this until the world is ready." This is key to understanding [[Nikos]]'s motivation.

- Deep level: Almost crushing pressure of age and magic

**Use the environment**:
- Shadows dancing from phosphorescent light
- Distant sounds (water, echoes) that aren't explained
- The sensation of being watched
