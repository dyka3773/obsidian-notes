# Location: Thessaloniki Catacombs

An ancient underground labyrinth beneath Thessaloniki, dating back to Alexander's era. It serves as the hidden resting place of [[the Crown of Kings]] and the domain of its eternal guardian, Nikias.

## Quick Overview
Beneath the bustling streets of Thessaloniki lies a vast maze of catacombs & burial chambers, mysterious tunnels, and forgotten shrines. The air is cold and damp. Ancient statues line the walls, some animate with magical protection. In its deepest chamber lies [[the Crown of Kings]], hidden from the world for over two thousand years.

## General Description
The catacombs smell of earth and age. Water drips from carved stone ceilings, creating echoes that make any sound feel amplified. Faint phosphorescent moss glows on portions of the walls, providing dim light. The air is thin and cool.

The walls are carved with ancient Greek inscriptions and intricate reliefs depicting Alexander's conquests, military campaigns, and mystical imagery. Many walls show signs of deliberate craftsmanship. Τhese catacombs were built with purpose, not accident.

As you venture deeper, the air grows colder. Magical auras shimmer faintly around certain areas. The deeper you go, the more you sense something _old_ and _aware_ watching you.

## Geography & Layout

### The Upper Catacombs (Entry Level)
**Atmosphere**: Burial chambers, can still smell the outside world
**Features**:
- Main entrance: Inside the Church of St. Dimitrios, through a hidden passage in the crypt
- Multiple burial alcoves carved into walls
- Stone sarcophagi with faded names
- Several side passages (some lead nowhere, some loop back)
- Ancient frescoes depicting funeral rites
- Christian and pre-Christian elements mixed (the catacombs predate the church)

**Access**: [[Dimitris]] should provide directions to the hidden entrance inside the church. The catacombs are known to locals as dangerous and forbidden (correct, there are [[Cultist Guard|cultist guards]] and traps).

### Mid-Level: The Guardian's Passages
**Atmosphere**: Becomes more mystical, temperature drops, magical auras visible

**The Three Doors**:
After completing [[Encounter - Infiltrating the Catacombs]], the party reaches a chamber with **three archways**, each sealed by a heavy stone door carved with different symbols:

- **Middle Door** (carved with two rampant lions): Leads to [[Encounter - The Stone Sentries]]
  - *Difficulty*: Medium - Combat with animated stone lions
  - *Estimated time*: 20-25 minutes
  
- **Left Door** (carved with a hunting dog): Leads to [[Encounter - Peritas's Trial]]
  - *Difficulty*: Medium - Combat/social/skill challenge with Alexander's spectral hound
  - *Estimated time*: 20-30 minutes
  
- **Right Door** (carved with a coiled serpent): Leads to [[Encounter - The Drakofido]]
  - *Difficulty*: Hard - Combat with puzzle elements against serpentine construct
  - *Estimated time*: 25-35 minutes

**Important**: The party must choose ONE door. All three paths eventually converge at the Junction Chamber before the relic chamber. They will only face one of these three guardian challenges.

**General Features** (common to all paths):
- Wider passages with high ceilings
- Statuary lining the walls (some animate)
- Pools of clear water (cold, deep, mysterious)
- Carved archways with ancient Greek inscriptions
- Signs of ancient habitation: bedrolls, simple supplies, fire pits
- Environmental hazards (unstable floors, hidden water channels)

### The Junction Chamber
**Atmosphere**: Transitional, all three paths converge here
**Features**:
- Medium-sized chamber where the three guardian paths meet
- Ancient scorch marks and claw scratches on the walls (evidence of past guardians)
- A small shrine with offerings (coins, flowers long dead, a rusted sword)
- Inscriptions in three languages: Greek, Persian, Egyptian
- Short rest opportunity (relatively safe, guardians don't patrol here)

**Purpose**: This gives the party a moment to catch their breath, heal, and prepare before facing [[Nikos]]. They might also realize that each path was equally dangerous, just in different ways.

### The Relic Chamber (Deepest Level)
**Atmosphere**: Sacred, ominous, otherworldly
**Features**:
- Circular chamber with high vaulted ceiling
- [[The Crown of Kings]] displayed on a stone pedestal in the center
- [[Nikos]]'s vigil station (a chair, a small shrine, books)
- Murals depicting Darius III's defeat and burial curses
- Magical glyphs arranged in protective circles around the relic

**Danger**: The air itself feels heavy with magic. Moving toward the relic triggers mystical alarms.

## Key Features

### The Stone Guardians
Multiple animated statues protect the catacombs:
- **Stone Lions** (2-4): Carved replicas of Alexander's companions, animated by ancient magic
- **Peritas the Hound** (spectral): Alexander's legendary dog, manifested as a ghostly guardian
- **The Drakofido** (in the deepest chamber): A massive serpentine dragon sculpture that animates to defend the relic chamber

### The Inscriptions
Throughout the catacombs are ancient Greek inscriptions. Some say:
- "Here lies the burden of the world's mightiest king"
- "Let no hand take what conquers all hands"

### The Water
Underground streams run through the catacombs. Some areas have:
- Deep underground pools (DC 13 Swim to cross)
- Flowing channels that could be dangerous
- Fresh spring water (safe to drink)

## Encounters in This Area

### Infiltration Challenge
[[Encounter - Infiltrating the Catacombs| Encounter: Infiltrating the Catacombs]] - Sneaking past guards and obstacles to reach the Three Doors

### Guardian Encounters (Choose ONE Path)
After infiltration, the party must choose **one of three doors**. They will only face **one** of these encounters:

- **Left Path**: [[Encounter - The Stone Sentries]] - Combat with animated stone lions (Medium difficulty)
- **Middle Path**: [[Encounter - Peritas's Trial]] - Test of courage/loyalty with spectral hound (Medium difficulty, multiple solutions)
- **Right Path**: [[Encounter - The Drakofido]] - Combat + puzzle with serpentine construct (Hard difficulty)

*All three paths converge at the Junction Chamber afterward.*

### The Champion's Test
[[Encounter - Nikos Guardian of Crown]] - Boss encounter with the eternal guardian

### The Betrayal
[[Encounter - The High Priests Betrayal]] - Confronting [[High Priest Vasilis|Vasilis]] in the relic chamber

## NPCs & Inhabitants

### Permanent
- **[[Nikos]]** - The eternal guardian, patron of the catacombs
- Stone guardians (non-communicative, magical constructs)
- Peritas (ghost, non-communicative, protective)

### Temporary (if employed by [[High Priest Vasilis|Vasilis]])
- 2-4 [[Cultist Guard|cultist guards]]
- [[High Priest Vasilis]] (arrives in final act)

## Travel & Time
- **From church entrance to Three Doors chamber**: 15-20 minutes (includes infiltration encounter)
- **From Three Doors through chosen path to Junction Chamber**: 20-35 minutes (includes one guardian encounter)
- **From Junction Chamber to relic chamber**: 5 minutes (includes preparation/roleplay)
- **Total descent time**: ~40-60 minutes of session time (includes encounters and exploration)

## Secrets & Hidden Elements

### Secret Passages
- A small hidden chamber contains old journals written by previous guardians (lore, clues about the relic)
- A passage leads to an underground river (could be escape route if needed)

### The Burial of Darius III
One section of the catacombs contains murals depicting Darius III's supposed burial. The party might realize the High Priest could be trying to reverse a curse or ritual.

### The Oath
Inscribed in the deepest chamber is the ancient oath taken by Alexander's general: "I and my line shall guard this until the world is ready." This is key to understanding [[Nikos]]'s motivation.

## Atmosphere Tips for DM

**Describe sensory details**:
- The drip-drip-drip of water echoing
- The smell of stone and earth
- The sound of your footsteps seems to come from everywhere at once
- Cold air on exposed skin
- The faint shimmer of magical auras

**Build tension gradually**:
- Upper catacombs: Eerie but relatively safe
- Mid-level: You feel something powerful here
- Deep level: Almost crushing pressure of age and magic

**Use the environment**:
- Shadows dancing from phosphorescent light
- Distant sounds (water, echoes) that aren't explained
- The sensation of being watched

## Connections
- **Church of St. Dimitrios**: Above ground, where the party meets [[High Priest Vasilis|Vasilis]] and where the entrance to the catacombs is hidden
- **Thessaloniki streets**: The way travelers reach the church
- **The relic chamber**: Heart of mystery, where fates are decided
