# The Crown of Kings

An ancient artifact of immense power, created by an unknown master craftsman for Alexander the Great. granting dominion over minds and will, but at a terrible cost.

## Basic Info
- **Name**: The Crown of Kings (also called the Diadem of Alexander)
- **Type**: Wondrous Item / Crown
- **Rarity**: Legendary (Artifact-level power)
- **Requires Attunement**: Yes (dangerous)
- **Source**: Created in ancient times; belongs to Alexander the Great
- **Current Location**: [[Location - Thessaloniki Catacombs]], relic chamber
- **Guardian**: [[Nikos]] (eternal protection)

## Appearance
The Crown is surprisingly simple for a legendary artifact. It's a circlet of pure gold, about 2 inches tall, topped with five jewels of various colors, emerald, sapphire, ruby, amethyst, and pearl. The band is inscribed with ancient Greek text in a language nearly as old as civilization itself.

When dormant, it appears to be beautiful but not remarkable, something a king might wear. When activated (by attunement or use of power), it glows with cold blue light, and the jewels pulse with color. Touching it causes a faint humming sensation that grows stronger the closer one gets to using its powers.

## Properties & Effects

### Command Dominion
When attuned to the Crown and wearing it, you gain:
- **Telepathic Command**: You can cast *[[Command]]* at will, no spell slots required
- **[[Mass Suggestion]]**: You can cast *[[Suggestion]]* on up to 5 creatures simultaneously (rather than 1)
- **[[Dominate Person]]**: You can cast *[[Dominate Person]]* once per long rest
- **Aura of Authority**: Creatures within 30 feet of you have disadvantage on saves against your Charisma-based spells

### Historical Knowledge
The wearer can access the Crown's memories:
- You gain perfect knowledge of Alexander's military campaigns
- You remember (as if you lived them) Alexander's greatest battles
- You understand military tactics instinctively (advantage on attack rolls and battle plans)
- But you also experience Alexander's final moments, his death, his regrets, his darkness

## Curses & Drawbacks

### The Corruption (Major Drawback)
The Crown is fundamentally corrupting. Wearing it for extended periods causes:

**After 1 hour of wear**:
- You feel invincible and superior
- All others seem beneath you
- You begin speaking in first person plural ("we" not "I")

**After 4 hours of wear**:
- You must make a DC 13 Wisdom save or be compelled to expand your dominion
- You want to control others, establish hierarchy, dominate rivals
- All attempts to persuade you to remove the Crown are made with disadvantage

**After 8 hours of wear**:
- You must make a DC 16 Wisdom save or be dominated by the Crown
- The Crown itself speaks to you, suggesting atrocities to secure your rule
- Memories of conquest and slaughter intrude on your thoughts
- Other people become mere tools to your ambitions

**After 24 hours of wear**:
- You cannot remove the Crown willingly
- You need a *[[Remove Curse]]* spell (DC 17) or divine intervention to remove it
- The Crown's voice becomes louder than your own thoughts

## History

### Creation and Alexander
The Crown was created by an unknown master, some sources claim a god, others claim a mortal with divine inspiration. It was meant as a gift to the greatest leader in the world. It found its way to Alexander the Great.

Alexander wore the Crown and achieved unprecedented conquest. With it, he bent the wills of kings, commanded vast armies, and reshaped the world. But the Crown corrupted him slowly. In the end, perhaps it killed him on his deathbed in Babylon. Or perhaps he finally removed it and died of shame at what he'd become.

### The Hiding
After Alexander's death, his general ([[Nikos]]'s ancestor) took the Crown and hid it. He knew its power was too great. He swore an oath: "I and my line will guard this until the world is ready for its truth."

That oath passed through generations. [[Nikos]] now carries it.

### The [[Resurrection]] Attempt
Recently, a scholar discovered writings about Darius III, Alexander's greatest enemy. The scholar became obsessed with the idea of resurrecting Darius III "to correct history." He turned to dark practices, eventually becoming the [[High Priest Vasilis]].

[[High Priest Vasilis|Vasilis]] has spent years researching the Crown and the [[resurrection]] ritual. He believes Darius III was wronged. With the Crown and the [[resurrection]], he could control Darius III and use him to build a new empire.

## How to Destroy the Crown

If the party wants to destroy the Crown and end the threat:

### Option A: Dispel the Magic
- Requires a powerful mage to cast *[[Dispel Magic]]* at 5th level or higher
- DC 17 Arcana check to succeed
- Destroys the Crown permanently
- Cannot be undone

### Option B: Consecrate It in the Holy Waters
- The Church of St. Dimitrios has an ancient spring beneath its crypt (the *Myrovlytes* miraculous spring)
- Submerging the Crown in these blessed waters for 24 hours destroys it
- Risk: The ritual requires a willing sacrifice (a life force to contain the released dark energy)

### Option C: Shatter It
- The Crown can be physically destroyed (AC 18, 25 HP)
- Shattering it breaks the curse but releases raw magical energy
- Everyone within 30 feet must make a DC 15 Dexterity save or take 6d6 force damage
- The gems scatter and become worthless (no longer magical)

### Option D: Seal It Away
- The catacombs can be sealed with magic
- A powerful ritual (wizard, cleric, or druid of 5+ level) can magically seal the crown chamber
- It remains buried forever, inert but not destroyed
- Risk: Future generations might try to unseal it

## Campaign Hooks

### If the Party Takes the Crown
- The cult won't stop hunting them
- They must decide when/if to use its power
- Corruption mechanics kick in (use the Corruption rules above)
- They need to find a way to either destroy it or live with it

### If [[Nikos]] Keeps It
- He returns to his eternal vigil
- But the party might check on him later
- The cult seeks revenge and tries again
- Or [[Nikos]] eventually asks them for help destroying it (sets up a campaign arc)

### If They Destroy It
- The immediate threat is over
- But destroying it might create an energy release (optional consequence)
- [[High Priest Vasilis|Vasilis]]'s followers are devastated, some become their allies, some seek revenge
- A few cultists realize [[High Priest Vasilis|Vasilis]] was wrong and join the party

### If They Lose It
- [[High Priest Vasilis|Vasilis]] or another villain gets the Crown
- They must stop whoever is using it (campaign begins!)
- Or they must find the Crown if it's stolen from [[High Priest Vasilis|Vasilis]]
- The corruption mechanics apply to whoever wears it

## DM Notes

- **Make the Crown feel important**: Describe its presence, its aura, its history
- **The choice at the end defines the campaign**:
  - Party keeps it → corruption arc
  - [[Nikos]] keeps it → protection arc (he becomes an ally)
  - Destroy it → climactic choice (sacrifice/power)
- **Don't let them ignore it**: The Crown is central to whether your campaign continues
- **Use the corruption gradually**: Don't jump from "I wear it for 1 hour" to "you're evil" instantly
- **The gems matter**: If destroyed, some might survive and become side quest items
- **Darius III is always a threat**: Even if not fully resurrected, his curse hangs over everything
