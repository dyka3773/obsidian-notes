# Encounter: Peritas's Trial

A spectral test guarded by the ghost of Alexander the Great's legendary hunting dog, Peritas.

## Overview
**Type**: Combat/Social/Skill Challenge
**Difficulty**: Medium
**Expected Duration**: 20-30 minutes
**XP Award**: 200 XP total (50 XP per character for 4 players)

## Situation
After choosing the **middle passage** following their infiltration, the party enters a long, narrow corridor. The temperature drops sharply. Their breath becomes visible. The phosphorescent moss dims, and a low growl echoes from the darkness ahead.

Emerging from the shadows is the ghostly form of a massive hunting dog. **Peritas**, Alexander's most loyal companion, who legend says gave his life to save his master from a charging elephant. The spectral hound blocks the path forward, eyes glowing with ethereal blue light.

### What Peritas Wants
Peritas doesn't just attack. He's testing the party's **worthiness**. Those who prove themselves brave, loyal, or clever may pass. Those who prove cowardly or cruel will face his wrath.

## Battle Map (Optional)
```
[Start]
   |
   |  (Long Corridor - 60 feet)
   |
[Peritas spawns here - 30 feet ahead]
   |
   |
   |  (Remaining 30 feet)
   |
[Door to deeper catacombs]
```

**Tactical Features**:
- **Narrow corridor**: Only 10 feet wide, limits flanking
- **Cold aura**: Area around Peritas (15-foot radius) is difficult terrain due to supernatural cold
- **Alcoves**: 2-3 small burial alcoves on either side (can provide half cover or hiding spots)

## Creatures

### Peritas, Spectral Guardian
**Use stat block**: **Specter**

```statblock
monster: Specter
name: Peritas
alignment: lawful good
```

**Tactical Behavior**:
- Peritas circles the party, testing their reactions
- Doesn't immediately attack. Waits to see if they show fear or aggression
- If attacked, retaliates with Life Drain
- If party shows bravery or respect, may pause

## The Trial: Three Paths to Victory

### Path 1: Prove Your Courage (Combat)
If the party stands their ground and fights without fleeing, Peritas respects their bravery. 

**Combat Flow**:
1. **Round 1-2**: Peritas tests them with hit-and-run tactics, using incorporeal movement to phase through party members
2. **Round 3**: If party is clearly fighting bravely (not running, helping fallen allies), Peritas stops attacking
3. **Resolution**: He fades with a respectful nod, the path opens

**Tactics**:
- Use Life Drain on the frontline fighter
- Phase through walls to flank spellcasters
- If someone falls unconscious but allies protect them, Peritas is impressed

### Path 2: Appeal to Loyalty (Social/RP)
A character can attempt to speak to Peritas, appealing to his legendary loyalty to Alexander.

**Skill Check**: DC 13 Charisma (Persuasion) or Wisdom (Animal Handling)

**Suggested approaches**:
- "We're not here for conquest. We're here to protect something precious, just like you"
- "Loyalty to a cause outlasts death, we understand that"
- Offering respect: kneeling, speaking in Greek, honoring Alexander's memory

**On Success**: Peritas pauses, recognizes kindred spirits, allows passage
**On Failure**: Peritas growls and attacks (but they can still try combat or skill path)

**DM Tip**: Reward creative roleplay. If a player references Alexander's history, Greek culture, or shows genuine respect, give them advantage on the check.

### Path 3: Prove Your Worth (Skill Challenge)
If the party tries to **evade or outsmart** Peritas rather than fight or persuade, run a skill challenge.

**Challenge**: 3 successes before 2 failures

**Possible Actions**:
- **DC 12 Dexterity (Stealth)**: Sneak through the alcoves while Peritas is distracted
- **DC 13 Intelligence (Arcana)**: Recognize the spectral binding and suggest a way to appease it
- **DC 11 Wisdom (Insight)**: Read Peritas's body language to predict his movements
- **DC 14 Strength (Athletics)**: Sprint past him when he phases through a wall
- **DC 10 Charisma (Performance)**: Howl or mimic dog behaviors to confuse him (this is silly but fun!)

**On Success**: They reach the far door, Peritas lets them pass with grudging respect
**On Failure**: Peritas attacks with advantage on his first strike, then combat begins

## Environmental Hazards
- **Supernatural Cold**: Any creature starting its turn within 15 feet of Peritas takes 1d4 cold damage
- **Narrow Space**: If someone falls unconscious, their body blocks part of the corridor (difficult terrain)

## Rewards

### Experience
- **Combat Victory**: 200 XP
- **Social Victory**: 200 XP (same reward, encourage non-combat solutions)
- **Skill Challenge Victory**: 200 XP

### Loot
- None (Peritas is a spirit guardian, not a treasure hoarder)

### Story Reward
- **Peritas's Blessing**: If the party impresses Peritas (especially through loyalty/bravery), he howls once before fading. Later, when they face [[Nikos]], if they mention Peritas approved of them, [[Nikos]] may be more willing to listen (advantage on first Persuasion check with [[Nikos]]).

## DM Notes & Tips

### Setting the Mood
**Describe sensory details**:
- "The air grows icy. Your breath mists before you."
- "A deep, mournful howl echoes through the stone corridor."
- "The ghostly dog's eyes fix on you, intelligent, testing."

**Peritas's behavior**:
- He's not mindless. He's Alexander's companion, cunning and loyal
- He circles, sniffs the air, tilts his head (recognizing bravery or cowardice)
- His growls intensify if party shows fear or cruelty

### Balancing for Your Party
**If party struggles**:
- Have Peritas clearly telegraph that he's *testing* them, not trying to kill them
- After 3 rounds of combat, have him visibly tire or hesitate (signaling they're close to victory)

**If party steamrolls**:
- Add 10 HP to Peritas
- Have him summon 1-2 minor frost wisps (1 HP each, distraction only)

### Avoiding a TPK
This is a challenging encounter for level 1. If things go badly:
- After reducing 2 party members to 0 HP, Peritas stops attacking (they've proven bravery by enduring)
- Peritas won't use Life Drain on unconscious characters
- Consider allowing death saving throws to have advantage due to supernatural cold (adrenaline)

### Roleplay Opportunities
- **Character backstory tie-in**: If a character has a pet or lost a companion, Peritas might acknowledge that kinship
- **Greek speakers**: If anyone speaks Greek (player or character), give them advantage on social checks with Peritas
- **Cleric/Paladin**: Divine characters might sense Peritas isn't evil. He's a guardian spirit bound by oath

## Aftermath
Once passed, the corridor opens into a junction where the three paths converge. The party can see (from a distance) that the other two paths end at the same junction, implying each path had a different guardian challenge.

They now proceed to [[Encounter - Nikos Guardian of Crown]].

## Connections
- **Previous Encounter**: [[Encounter - Infiltrating the Catacombs]]
- **Next Encounter**: [[Encounter - Nikos Guardian of Crown]]
- **Location**: [[Location - Thessaloniki Catacombs]]
- **Campaign**: [[Campaign - The Relic of Alexander]]

**Alternate Encounter**: This encounter is one of three possible mid-level challenges. The party will only face one of:
- [[Encounter - The Stone Sentries]] (left path)
- [[Encounter - Peritas's Trial]] (middle path)
- [[Encounter - The Drakofido]] (right path)
