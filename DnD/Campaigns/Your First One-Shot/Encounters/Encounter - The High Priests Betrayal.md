# Encounter: The High Priest's Betrayal

The climactic battle. [[High Priest Vasilis|Vasilis]] arrives at the relic chamber to claim [[the Crown of Kings]] and begin his [[resurrection]] ritual. The party must stop him.

## Overview
[[High Priest Vasilis|Vasilis]] enters with [[Cultist Guard|cultist guards]], revealing his true intentions. He's willing to fight the party, sacrifice his guards, and use the crown to resurrect Darius III. The party must defeat him or stop the ritual before it completes.

## Encounter Type
- **Type**: Combat / Final Boss
- **Location**: [[Location - Thessaloniki Catacombs]] (relic chamber)
- **Difficulty**: Hard (with difficulty scaling based on prior encounters)
- **Party Level**: 1
- **Estimated Duration**: 20-30 minutes

## Setup

### [[High Priest Vasilis|Vasilis]] Arrives

**Trigger**: The party reaches the relic chamber and has dealt with [[Nikos]] (however they handled it). Suddenly, more footsteps echo from the passage. Torchlight flickers on distant walls.

**Visual Description**:
> "The footsteps grow louder. Shadows dance on the walls, many shadows. [[High Priest Vasilis|Vasilis]] enters, flanked by four [[Cultist Guard|cultist guards]]. His crimson robes flow around him, and his golden amulet glows with mystical power. His expression is one of triumph and benevolence.
>
> 'Ah, you've retrieved the crown for me. Excellent. I knew I could trust you.' He pauses, his eyes narrowing as he takes in the scene, perhaps [[Nikos]]'s body, or the party's battle-worn appearance.
>
> 'Or perhaps... you've changed your minds?' A smile plays across his lips, and suddenly he doesn't seem benevolent at all. 'No matter. I am done asking nicely.'"

### [[High Priest Vasilis|Vasilis]]'s Monologue (Optional)
If you want to give players information before combat:

> "Do you even know what you've protected? Or what you've stolen? This crown belonged to Alexander, the tyrant who conquered the world. Before him, Darius III ruled, a just king, destroyed by Alexander's ambition.
>
> This crown grants dominion over minds, bodies, and wills. With it, I can resurrect Darius III and restore proper order. He will forgive me for allowing his enemy's legacy to persist so long.
>
> You've served me well, adventurers. Now stand aside, or die."

## Battle Setup

### The Relic Chamber
```
            Passage (Vasilis enters from here)
                    |
                    |
            Stone Pedestal (Crown)
                    |
            Ceiling opens to "stars"
            
Pillars provide cover
Water basins (nonlethal hazard)
Narrow passages limit movement
```

### Tactical Options for DM

**Option A (Harder)**: All 4 guards + [[High Priest Vasilis|Vasilis]] fight together
- Guards spread out, [[High Priest Vasilis|Vasilis]] casts spells from range
- This is very hard for level 1 PCs

**Option B (Recommended)**: 2 guards initially + [[High Priest Vasilis|Vasilis]]
- More guards arrive in 2 rounds (good tension)
- Allows party to focus on [[High Priest Vasilis|Vasilis]]

**Option C (Easier)**: Guards surrender or flee
- [[High Priest Vasilis|Vasilis]] fights alone (still dangerous if he has spells)
- Use if party is already wounded

## Combat Flow

### Round 1
- [[High Priest Vasilis|Vasilis]] positions himself near or behind the crown
- Guards move to intercept party
- [[High Priest Vasilis|Vasilis]] casts [[Scorching Ray]] or [[Magic Missile]] as opening salvo

### Rounds 2-3
- Guards engage party members in melee
- [[High Priest Vasilis|Vasilis]] continues spellcasting
- If [[Nikos]] is alive and allied, he fights guards while party targets [[High Priest Vasilis|Vasilis]]

### Rounds 4+
- Guards may start fleeing (they're not fanatics)
- [[High Priest Vasilis|Vasilis]] uses [[Hold Person]] or [[Suggestion]] to disable party members
- Emergency reinforcements might arrive (more cult members)

## The Ritual (Time Pressure)

### [[High Priest Vasilis|Vasilis]]'s Goal
If [[High Priest Vasilis|Vasilis]] reaches the crown and makes contact with it, **he can begin the [[resurrection]] ritual**.

- **Round 1**: He speaks in ancient language, the crown glows
- **Round 2**: Magical energy swirls, the relic chamber shakes
- **Round 3**: If not interrupted, Darius III's spirit manifests (boss appears)

### Interrupting the Ritual
- Damage [[High Priest Vasilis|Vasilis]] (he loses concentration)
- [[Dispel Magic]] (DC 15 Arcana check)
- Destroy the crown (very difficult)
- Grab the crown and move it away from [[High Priest Vasilis|Vasilis]]

## Possible Outcomes

### Party Victory ([[High Priest Vasilis|Vasilis]] Defeated)
- [[High Priest Vasilis|Vasilis]] falls, his cultists either die or scatter
- The crown remains on the pedestal, inert
- If [[Nikos]] survived, he thanks them
- Party must decide what to do with the crown

### Ritual Completes (Darius III Rises)
If [[High Priest Vasilis|Vasilis]] completes the ritual:
- A ghostly, terrible form rises from a hidden tomb
- Darius III, the Persian Emperor, manifests as a bound spirit
- He is FURIOUS and seeks to destroy everything
- This becomes a second phase of combat (harder, but shorter)
- **Suggested Change**: Don't let this happen unless players really fail; cut to black and fade to next scene

### Stalemate/Compromise
- Party destroys the crown ([[High Priest Vasilis|Vasilis]] cries out in anguish)
- [[High Priest Vasilis|Vasilis]] flees, vowing revenge
- The one-shot ends with ambiguous victory

## Stat Block: Darius III (If He Manifests)

Only use if the ritual completes. Make it frightening and powerful.

## Encounter Progression

### Timeline
- 2 min: [[High Priest Vasilis|Vasilis]]'s entrance and monologue
- 2 min: Initiative and positioning
- 15-20 min: Combat (3-4 rounds)
- 3-5 min: Resolution and ending

## What Happens After Victory

### If Party Defeats [[High Priest Vasilis|Vasilis]]
1. **[[Nikos]] lives**: He assumes guardianship of the crown and thanks the party
2. **[[Nikos]] died**: Party inherits the burden. What do they do with the crown?
3. **Guards talk**: If captured, they reveal more about the cult (for campaign continuation)

### The Crown Decision
- **Destroy it**: Removes the threat forever but loses immense power
- **Guard it**: Party becomes the new guardian (hooks for campaign)
- **Hide it**: [[Nikos]] or party chooses a new location
- **Study it**: Take it to scholars in the city (danger: the cult will hunt them)

### Ending Scenes
- Party exits catacombs to cheers from city guards
- They're rewarded by the grateful people
- Seeds planted for future adventures
- Or, the dead [[High Priest Vasilis|Vasilis]]'s cult vows revenge...

## DM Notes
- This is the climax. Make it feel epic and dangerous
- Don't pull punches with [[High Priest Vasilis|Vasilis]]'s spells, but don't kill PCs unfairly
- Let players feel the weight of their choices (what to do with the crown)
- If the party is winning too easily, have Darius III start manifesting (scare them)
- If party is losing, Remember they can flee, this isn't a death trap
- The final image should be dramatic: Crown glowing, party standing over [[High Priest Vasilis|Vasilis]], decision to make
