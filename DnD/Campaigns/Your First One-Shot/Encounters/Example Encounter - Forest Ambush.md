4. **Begin Encounter**

## Tactical Notes

### Goblin Strategy
- **Round 1**: All goblins use shortbow from cover
- **Round 2+**: 
  - If party closes distance, switch to scimitar
  - Use Nimble Escape to Disengage/Hide
  - Focus fire on weakest-looking PC
- **Retreat**: If 2 goblins die, remaining one flees

### Terrain Features
- **Trees**: Half cover (+2 AC, +2 DEX saves)
- **Boulders**: Three-quarters cover (+5 AC, +5 DEX saves)
- **Underbrush**: Difficult terrain (costs double movement)

### Tips for Running
- Goblins are cowardly - roleplay their fear
- Use Nimble Escape to show mobility
- Let players use terrain creatively
- Don't forget opportunity attacks when goblins flee!

## Treasure/Rewards

### Per Goblin
- 1d6 silver pieces: `dice: 1d6|Goblin 1 Silver` `dice: 1d6|Goblin 2 Silver` `dice: 1d6|Goblin 3 Silver`
- Scimitar (5 sp)
- Shortbow + 10 arrows (25 gp)

### Hidden Stash
If party searches the area (DC 12 Investigation):
- Small pouch with 20 gp
- Stolen silver ring (10 gp value)
- Note: "Meet at the old mill at dusk - B"

**Total XP**: 150 XP (50 per goblin) ÷ 4 PCs = **37 XP each**

## Encounter Flow

### Start
> "As you round a bend in the forest road, three ragged figures leap from behind trees with weapons drawn! Roll initiative!"

### During Combat
- Describe goblin cackles and taunts in Common
- "The goblin grins wickedly as it nocks another arrow..."
- "With a yelp, the goblin scrambles behind a boulder!"

### Resolution
- **Party Victory**: Goblins flee or die, party can search bodies/area
- **Goblin Escape**: They retreat to a nearby hide-out (could be follow-up encounter)
- **Party Defeat**: Goblins rob party but don't kill them (wake up with no gold/items)

## Follow-up Hooks
- The note mentions "B" - who is that?
- Where is "the old mill"? What are goblins planning?
- More goblins might be nearby
- Someone in town has been reporting goblin activity

## DM Notes
- First combat should be manageable but not trivial
- Teach cover, terrain, movement
- Show that enemies can flee - not everything is fight to death
- Use this to introduce larger plot if desired
