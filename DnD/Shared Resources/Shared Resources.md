# Shared Resources

Reference materials and resources shared across all D&D campaigns.

## 5e Rules & References
Quick access to D&D 5e 2024 mechanics, rules, and how-tos.

```dataview
LIST file.link
FROM "DnD/Shared Resources/5e Rules & References"
SORT file.name
```

**Common Topics to Create**:
- Proficiency & Ability Checks
- Attack Rolls & Damage
- Spell Casting Rules
- Condition Effects
- How to Adjudicate [X]
- Encounter Difficulty Guidelines
- XP & Leveling

## Monsters & Stat Blocks
Directory of monsters you've used or may use.

```dataview
LIST file.link
FROM "DnD/Shared Resources/Monsters"
SORT file.name
```

**How to Use**: 
- Save stat blocks you find or create
- Copy the exact stat block into a file named after the creature
- Link to it when you use it in an encounter
- Makes it easy to reuse creatures across campaigns

## Magic Items
Magic items and special treasures.

```dataview
LIST file.link
FROM "DnD/Shared Resources/Magic Items"
SORT file.name
```

**Tip**: When the party finds a magic item, consider:
1. Create a note in the loot folder of that campaign
2. If it's a unique item, link to it
3. Use this folder for special/unique items you might reference across campaigns

## NPCs & Factions (Optional)
If you want to reuse NPCs or organizations across campaigns, add them here and link to campaign-specific versions.
