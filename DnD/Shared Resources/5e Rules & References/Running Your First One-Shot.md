# Guide: Running Your First One-Shot

## Before You Play

### 1. Know Your Story
Write down in 1-2 sentences: What is this one-shot about?
- Who is the enemy/challenge?
- Why should players care?
- What's the ending?

### 2. Create 2-3 Encounters
You want:
- **Opening encounter**: Gets the story going (can be social, discovery, or combat)
- **Middle encounter**: Main challenge (usually combat or major decision)
- **Final encounter**: Climax and resolution

### 3. Create 3-5 NPCs
Key rule: **One memorable trait per NPC**
- **Tavern keeper**: Unusually knowledgeable about secrets
- **Guard captain**: Brash, speaks before thinking
- **Quest-giver**: Mysterious motives, cryptic speech

Don't memorize them - just know what they want and how they talk.

### 4. Prep Your Locations
For each location, prepare:
- What it looks like (2-3 key details)
- What NPCs are there
- What could go wrong

**Don't over-describe** - let the story flow.

### 5. Gather Your Materials
- Dice (lots of d20s, d8s for damage)
- Monster stat blocks (copy to [[Shared Resources/Monsters]])
- Map or battlemat (optional but helpful)
- Character sheets of monsters

## Post-Session

### After Everyone Leaves
1. **Write session notes** - what actually happened
2. **Note what worked** - funny moments, good encounters
3. **Note what didn't** - confusing rules, NPCs, encounters
4. **Track loot** - what did party get?
5. **Plan next session** - if there is one

**Use the [[Session template]]** to record everything.
