# Guide: Running Your First One-Shot

## Before You Play

### 1. Know Your Story
Write down in 1-2 sentences: What is this one-shot about?
- Who is the enemy/challenge?
- Why should players care?
- What's the ending?

### 2. Create 2-3 Encounters
You want:
- **Opening encounter**: Gets the story going (can be social, discovery, or combat)
- **Middle encounter**: Main challenge (usually combat or major decision)
- **Final encounter**: Climax and resolution

### 3. Create 3-5 NPCs
Key rule: **One memorable trait per NPC**
- **Tavern keeper**: Unusually knowledgeable about secrets
- **Guard captain**: Brash, speaks before thinking
- **Quest-giver**: Mysterious motives, cryptic speech

Don't memorize them - just know what they want and how they talk.

### 4. Prep Your Locations
For each location, prepare:
- What it looks like (2-3 key details)
- What NPCs are there
- What could go wrong

**Don't over-describe** - let the story flow.

### 5. Gather Your Materials
- Dice (lots of d20s, d8s for damage)
- Monster stat blocks (copy to [[Shared Resources/Monsters]])
- Map or battlemat (optional but helpful)
- Character sheets of monsters

## Running the Session

### Opening (First 10 Minutes)
1. **Greet everyone**, get them seated
2. **Quick recap** of house rules (if any)
3. **Describe the opening scene**: "You find yourselves in..."
4. **Ask**: "What do you do?"
5. **Then react** to their choice

**Opening Hook Ideas**:
- They're hired for a job
- They witness something strange
- They're accused of something
- A friend is in trouble
- They find a mysterious item

### During Play
- **Listen to your players** - they'll surprise you with cool ideas
- **When they ask "Can I do X?"** - answer "Yes, if you...[some check/consequence]"
- **When uncertain** - call a break, look it up, come back
- **Keep the energy** - if something isn't working, skip ahead
- **Use voices** - doesn't need to be fancy, just different

### Combat
1. **Roll initiative** (1d20 + DEX)
2. **Start of round**: Describe enemy position/intent
3. **Go round by round**: Each player acts, then enemies
4. **Resolve**: Attacks, saves, damage
5. **Repeat** until enemies down or fleeing

**Don't stress combat balance** - if combat is deadly, offer a way to surrender or escape.

### Social Encounters
- **Ask what they say**: "What do you do?"
- **Tell them the NPC's response**
- **Roll only if risky**: Persuasion vs. Insight, etc.
- **Don't railroad**: Let them negotiate, threaten, befriend

## Common Problems & Solutions

### "That's Too Easy/Hard"
- **Too easy?** Add more enemies, complications, time pressure
- **Too hard?** Enemies get captured, retreat, offer surrender
- **Remember**: It's not about winning - it's about fun

### "Someone's Hogging the Spotlight"
- Directly ask quieter players: "What does your character do?"
- Give each PC a moment in the spotlight

### "Players Ignored My Big Plot Point"
- **Don't panic** - just move it forward differently
- Save that NPC/location for another session
- Most players won't notice!

### "I Forgot What I Prepped"
- Keep notes in front of you
- It's okay to say "Give me a second to check my notes"
- Players won't know if you skip or change things

### "They Want to Do Something Not Planned"
- **This is good!** The best D&D moments are improvised
- Call for a check
- Describe the outcome
- Keep moving

---

## Post-Session

### After Everyone Leaves
1. **Write session notes** - what actually happened
2. **Note what worked** - funny moments, good encounters
3. **Note what didn't** - confusing rules, NPCs, encounters
4. **Track loot** - what did party get?
5. **Plan next session** - if there is one

**Use the [[Session template]]** to record everything.

## Tips for Success

✓ **Be prepared but flexible** - know your encounters but adapt on the fly
✓ **Start combat immediately** if things drag - action keeps energy up
✓ **Describe with senses** - "what do you see/hear?" not just map positioning
✓ **Make failure interesting** - failed check = plot twist, not "nothing happens"
✓ **Let players be heroes** - give them moments where they're incredibly cool
✓ **Have NPCs react** to cool stuff players do - makes them feel awesome
✓ **Admit mistakes** - "Actually, that's not how that works" is fine
✓ **Move on** - don't get stuck on rules, keep the story moving
