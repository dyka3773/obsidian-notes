# D&D 5e 2024 DM Quick Reference

A quick reference guide for common DMing situations and 5e 2024 rules. Build this out as you play!

## Common DM Tasks

### When the Party Wants to Do Something Unexpected
1. **Ask yourself**: "Is this possible?"
2. **Call for a check** if there's risk: Ability check, attack roll, or saving throw
3. **Set the DC** based on difficulty (DC 10 = easy, 15 = medium, 20 = hard)
4. **Roll it out** or let them know the outcome
5. **Move on** - don't get bogged down

### Encounter Difficulty
**Quick Estimate** (per player):
- Easy: 25 XP worth of enemies
- Medium: 50 XP worth of enemies
- Hard: 75 XP worth of enemies
- Deadly: 100+ XP worth of enemies

### How to Adjudicate [Something]
Create a note for these as you encounter situations:
- [ ] Grappling
- [ ] Shoving/Knocking Prone
- [ ] Help Action
- [ ] Hiding
- [ ] Climbing/Swimming
- [ ] Spells Interacting with Each Other
- [ ] When to Allow Death

## Combat Essentials
- **Initiative**: 1d20 + DEX modifier (highest goes first)
- **Attack Roll**: 1d20 + attack bonus vs. AC
- **Damage**: Roll dice shown + any bonuses
- **Advantage/Disadvantage**: Roll twice, use higher/lower

## Ability Checks
**DC Guidelines**:
- DC 10 = Easy
- DC 12 = Medium
- DC 15 = Hard
- DC 18 = Very Hard
- DC 20+ = Extremely Hard

## Common Spellcasting Questions
- [ ] Spell range and area
- [ ] What happens if you cast concentrations spells simultaneously?
- [ ] Can you move between attacks?
- [ ] Spell slots and preparation

## Trap & Hazard DC
- **DC 10**: Simple trap (trip wire)
- **DC 15**: Well-hidden trap
- **DC 20**: Magical or complex trap

## Conditions (Remember These!)
- **Blinded**: Can't see, auto-fail sight checks
- **Frightened**: Has disadvantage on rolls while scared thing is near
- **Grappled**: Speed = 0, can't move except by dragging grappler
- **Invisible**: Can't be seen
- **Paralyzed**: Can't move or take actions
- **Petrified**: Turned to stone, immune to most effects
- **Poisoned**: Disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks
- **Prone**: Can't stand without 1/2 speed, ranged attacks vs. prone = disadvantage
- **Restrained**: Speed = 0, disadvantage on DEX saves
- **Unconscious**: Falls prone, can't move/speak, auto-fail STR/DEX saves

## Building Encounters

### Step 1: Pick Enemies
Use 5e monsters that match your party's level.

### Step 2: Calculate Difficulty
Total XP of all monsters ÷ number of PCs = XP per PC
- 25 = Easy
- 50 = Medium  
- 75 = Hard
- 100+ = Deadly

### Step 3: Adjust as Needed
The formula is a guideline, not gospel. Consider:
- Action economy (lots of weak enemies is harder than one strong one)
- Terrain and cover (gives disadvantage/advantage)
- Reinforcements (if more enemies arrive)
- Environment hazards

## Roleplay Tips for New DMs
- **Voices**: Don't do elaborate voices if uncomfortable. Just use tone/cadence
- **NPCs**: One weird trait is enough (accent, speech quirk, habit)
- **Describing**: "What do you see/hear/smell?" helps engage players
- **When stuck**: Ask the players what they want to do - keep moving
- **Failure is fun**: Let bad rolls create interesting situations

## Session Structure
1. **Recap** (5 min): What happened last time?
2. **Hook** (5 min): "You're in [location], [something] happens"
3. **Encounters** (30-40 min each): Combat, social, exploration
4. **Conclusion** (10 min): Wrap up, set next hook

## Experience & Leveling (5e 2024)
- Share XP among party equally
- Level up every 1-3 sessions for beginners
- Tell players when they level up!

## Resources You'll Want to Create
As you play and encounter situations, create notes for:
- [ ] Rules you look up frequently
- [ ] Monsters you reuse
- [ ] Magic items
- [ ] Recurring NPCs
