# Bugbear

Bugbears are hairy goblinoids that excel at ambushes and brutal melee combat.

## Stat Block
```statblock
monster: Bugbear
```

## Tactical Notes
- **AC**: 16 (hide armor, shield)
- **HP**: 27 (5d8 + 5)
- **Speed**: 30 ft.
- **Initiative**: +2 (DEX modifier)
- **Stealth**: +6 (surprisingly sneaky!)

### Combat Behavior
- **Surprise Attack**: Deals extra `dice: 2d6|Surprise Damage` damage if attacking surprised target
- **Brute**: Deals extra damage die on melee weapon hits
- **Ambush Predator**: Prefers to attack from hiding
- **Fights to the Death**: Unlike goblins, bugbears are brave

### Key Attacks
- **Morningstar**: `dice: 1d20+4|Bugbear Morningstar Attack` to hit, reach 5 ft., `dice: 2d8+2|Piercing Damage` damage
- **Javelin**: `dice: 1d20+4|Bugbear Javelin Attack` to hit, range 30/120, `dice: 2d6+2|Piercing Damage` damage

## Encounter Design
- **Solo Encounter**: 1 bugbear for 4 level 1 PCs (medium)
- **With Minions**: 1 bugbear + 4 goblins (hard for level 1-2)
- **Ambush Setup**: Bugbear hidden, goblins visible as distraction

## Roleplay Notes
- Speak broken Common
- Lazy and cruel
- Follow stronger leaders (hobgoblins, goblin kings)
- Motivated by treasure and violence
