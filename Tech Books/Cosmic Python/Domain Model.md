The _domain_ is a fancy way of saying _the problem you’re trying to solve._ 
Your authors currently work for an online retailer of furniture. 
Depending on which system you’re talking about, the domain might be purchasing and procurement, or product design, or logistics and delivery. 
Most programmers spend their days trying to improve or automate business processes; the domain is the set of activities that those processes support.

A _model_ is a map of a process or phenomenon that captures a useful property. 
Humans are exceptionally good at producing models of things in their heads. 
For example, when someone throws a ball toward you, you’re able to predict its movement almost unconsciously, because you have a model of the way objects move in space. 
Your model isn’t perfect by any means. 
Humans have terrible intuitions about how objects behave at near-light speeds or in a vacuum because our model was never designed to cover those cases. 
That doesn’t mean the model is wrong, but it does mean that some predictions fall outside of its domain.

The domain model is the mental map that business owners have of their businesses. 
All business people have these mental maps—​they’re how humans think about complex processes.

You can tell when they’re navigating these maps because they use business speak. 
Jargon arises naturally among people who are collaborating on complex systems.
